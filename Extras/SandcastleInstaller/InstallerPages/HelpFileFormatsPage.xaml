      <Paragraph>Sandcastle will produce output that can be used to create help files in various formats.
However, it cannot create the actual file that is the end result.  For that, help compilers or third-party
build tools are required.  Below is a summary of the help file formats and the tools needed to produce
them.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph><Bold>HTML Help 1</Bold></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph Margin="30,0,0,0">HTML Help 1 files are standalone help files with a <Italic>.chm</Italic>
extension.  This is the oldest help file format and these files can be viewed on any system without any
special viewers.  The Help 1 compiler is installed as part of the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph><Bold>Microsoft Help 2</Bold></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph Margin="30,0,0,0">The Microsoft Help 2 format produces help files with a
        <Italic>.HxS</Italic> extension.
These are not standalone files.  In order to view them, they must be integrated into a help collection.
These are typically used to provide help for control libraries and tools and are integrated into the help
collections used by Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and earlier.  The Help 2 compiler does not appear to be
available separately and must be installed as part of one of the SDKs for Visual Studio 2008 or earlier.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph><Bold>Microsoft Help Viewer</Bold></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph Margin="30,0,0,0">This is the latest help file format and produces help files with a
<Italic>.mshc</Italic> extension.  These help files are typically used to provide help for control libraries
and tools used with Visual Studio 2010 and later.  They are similar to Help 2 files in that they must be
installed into a collection to be viewed but they do not require a compiler.  Instead, the help content is
compressed into a ZIP-format archive file.  Third-party build tools for Sandcastle will provide the support
necessary to create the help archive and its related configuration file.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph><Bold>Websites</Bold></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph Margin="30,0,0,0">The topic files produces by Sandcastle are HTML files and can be used to
create help content that is uploaded to a web server.  However, Sandcastle itself does not provide any
support for creating a web-based table of content, index, or search functionality.  These features are left
to the third-party build tools.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>The following steps will check for the Help 1 and Help 2 compilers and give you
instructions on downloading and installing them if necessary.</Paragraph>
