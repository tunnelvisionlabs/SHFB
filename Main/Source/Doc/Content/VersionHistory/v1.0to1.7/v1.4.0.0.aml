      <para>Version 1.4.0.0 was released on March 11, 2007.</para>

      <title>Changes in This Release</title>
      <content>
<list class="bullet">
    <listItem>Added support for the March 2007 CTP of Sandcastle.</listItem>

    <listItem><legacyBold>NOTE:</legacyBold> The default configurations for the
<codeInline>CodeBlockComponent</codeInline> and <codeInline>PostTransformComponent</codeInline>
have changed and <legacyBold><legacyUnderline>must be reset</legacyUnderline></legacyBold> and reconfigured if you
customized them via the <codeInline>ComponentConfigurations</codeInline> project
option.  Line numbering and outlining are now off by default.  A new option
"Connect code blocks to language filter" has been added to allow connecting
the code blocks to the language filter.  If enabled (the default), code
blocks are shown or hidden based on the language filter setting.  If
disabled, code blocks are always shown regardless of the language filter
setting.  Options are also present to set the location of the "Copy" image
and the file path for it.</listItem>

    <listItem>Made some significant performance improvements.  Build times in some
cases involving extremely large numbers of topics can be reduced by up to
50% or more.  The larger the number of topics to document, the more significant
the decrease in build time.
    <list class="bullet">
        <listItem>Optimized loading and saving of the reflection information file
and the XML comments files within the build engine.</listItem>

        <listItem>Optimized the purge item code and duplicate checking in the
name generation code to eliminate unnecessary XPath lookups.</listItem>

        <listItem>The processing for the <codeInline>ShowMissing*</codeInline> options has
been moved into a new build component (<codeInline>ShowMissingComponent</codeInline>).
On extremely large documentation builds (tens of thousands of topics), the
XPath queries that were used to look up the member comments and the
information in the reflection file took an extremely long time.  By moving
the processing to a build component, the amount of information to search is
greatly reduced and the time to add missing item comments is now
negligible.</listItem>

        <listItem>The version information lookup part of the
<codeInline>PostTransformComponent</codeInline> was split out into a new
<codeInline>VersionInfoComponent</codeInline> that runs before transformation of the
topic occurs.  This allows for an optimized lookup of the version
information and the whole reflection file does not need to be loaded thus
reducing memory usage for large builds and speeding up the searches for
version information.</listItem>

        <listItem>Added build step timing information so that it is easier to see
which steps are taking the longest during a build.</listItem>
    </list>

    <listItem>The console mode builder can now accept project properties as
command line options to override or add settings to a project.  A response
file can also be used to avoid problems with long command lines.  See the
<link xlink:href="8ffc0d37-0215-4609-b6f8-dba53a6c5063" /> topic for details.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>WorkingPath</codeInline> property so that you can specify
an alternate location with a shorter path in which to perform the build if
it fails due to long file path names.</listItem>

    <listItem><para>The following file and folder project properties have been
converted from strings to objects.  This allows them to be persisted as paths
relative to the current project location rather than as absolute paths at your
choosing.  In addition, environment variables such as
<environmentVariable>%DXROOT%</environmentVariable>,
<environmentVariable>%WINDIR%</environmentVariable>, etc. can be specified in
the paths and they will be expanded at build time to the value of the
specified environment variable. Properties affected:</para>

    <list class="bullet">
        <listItem>SandcastleProject.HtmlHelp1xCompilerPath</listItem>
        <listItem>SandcastleProject.HtmlHelp2xCompilerPath</listItem>
        <listItem>SandcastleProject.SandcastlePath</listItem>
        <listItem>SandcastleProject.WorkingPath</listItem>
        <listItem>DocumentAssembly.AssemblyPath</listItem>
        <listItem>DocumentAssembly.XmlCommentsPath</listItem>
        <listItem>ContentItem.SourcePath</listItem>
        <listItem>DependencyItem.DependencyPath</listItem>
    </list>

<para>The <codeInline>OutputPath</codeInline> property is still a string.  If relative,
it is always relative to the project folder and thus should not point at
the prior location if the project is saved in a new folder.  For similar
reasons, the <codeInline>DestinationPath</codeInline> property of additional content
items has also been left as a string.</para></listItem>

<para>All fully qualified paths in the affected properties in projects
created by prior versions of the help file builder will become relative
paths automatically when opened in the latest version.  If you need a fixed
path, expand the property and set the <codeInline>IsFixedPath</codeInline> property to
true so that it is saved as an absolute rather than a relative path.</para></listItem>

    <listItem>It is now possible to resolve project option values and shared
content items in additional content files.  See the
<link xlink:href="8ea650b6-ab50-4288-a930-baf5b58a4cb0" /> help topic in the
<link xlink:href="4fd3b2b6-dfad-4513-983b-5e74d2342ff0" /> section for details.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug in the code to resolve links to namespace content from
additional content that caused it to add too many relative path parts to
the URLs.  Fixed a bug that caused it to miss the default page setting if
the page was associated with a folder.  Also fixed a bug that caused it to
ignore the page if it was associated with a folder and it was the only
file in the folder.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug in the code colorizer caused by the description for the
collapsed region not being HTML encoded.  Also fixed up the definitions so
that it doesn't colorize preprocessor text within quotes and comments and
handles XML attribute names containing colons.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed the <codeInline>CodeBlockComponent</codeInline> and the code colorizer so
that they recognize VB.NET style <codeInline>#Else If</codeInline>, <codeInline>#End
If</codeInline>, and <codeInline>#End Region</codeInline> statements.</listItem>

    <listItem>The code colorizer now renders a "Copy" icon and text to the right
of each title line on the code blocks and allows you to copy the code to
the clipboard.  The code is copied as plain text without the highlighting
and line numbers if used. Default titles are also used on code block that
do not have a title.  The default title is based on the language specified.</listItem>

    <listItem>Modified the the C++ comments fixup code so that it only strips out
the unnecessary characters if they appear in a declaration involving the
<codeInline>System.Collections.Generic</codeInline> namespace.</listItem>

    <listItem>The <codeInline>PresentationStyle</codeInline> property now uses a type
converter that allows you to select any folder under the
<legacyBold>.\Presentation</legacyBold> folder in the main Sandcastle installation folder.
This allows you to create custom versions of the Prototype and VS2005
styles using different names and select them for use from within a help
file builder project.</listItem>

    <listItem>The build process now tries to delete the help file first if it
exists so that it stops immediately if the help file is open and cannot be
overwritten.</listItem>

    <listItem>Made the file extension checks case-insensitive when adding
assemblies and comments files to the project and when examining additional
content files during the build.</listItem>

    <listItem>When documenting internals, private fields backing events are now
removed as they can never be documented with comments.</listItem>

    <listItem>Removed extraneous paragraph tags from the formatted footer
replacement tag values.</listItem>

    <listItem>Modified the <codeInline>comments</codeInline> shared content item so that the
e-mail link in the page footers now appends the current topic's title to
the help file's title for the e-mail's subject.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added a <legacyBold>FooterText</legacyBold> property to the project that lets you add
additional text to the footer of each page without having to modify the
shared content file.  The text is inserted at the start of the
<codeInline>footer</codeInline> shared content item.</listItem>

    <listItem>The post-transform component now turns off all file attributes when
copying the highlighter and logo files so that they can be deleted at the
end of the build when <codeInline>CleanIntermediates</codeInline> is set to true.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added <codeInline>placement</codeInline> and <codeInline>alignment</codeInline> attributes
to the <codeInline>logoFile</codeInline> element of the post-transform component.  This
allows the logo to be placed to the left, right, or above the topic title.
When placed above the topic title, it can be aligned to the left or right
or centered.</listItem>

    <listItem>Moved the version information text to the end of the location
information shared content items.  The <codeInline>PostTransformComponent</codeInline>
now moves the location/version text to the end of the footer in the
Prototype style.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added a <legacyBold>Delete</legacyBold> button to the <legacyBold>Namespaces</legacyBold> dialog that
lets you remove old namespaces from the list that no longer appear in the
assemblies.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added <codeInline>Help1xAndHelp2x</codeInline> and
<codeInline>Help1xAnd2xAndWebsite</codeInline> options to the <codeInline>HelpFileFormat</codeInline>
project option.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added an <codeInline>ExcludeItems</codeInline> property to the additional
content items.  If set to true, the file or files matching the source path
are excluded.  If used with a wildcard source path, all matching files in
subfolders are excluded as well.</listItem>
