<list class="bullet">
	<listItem>Full Microsoft Help Viewer support has been implemented within the
Sandcastle Help File Builder.  However, please note that only the <legacyBold>VS2005</legacyBold>
presentation style contains the necessary resources and XSL transformations to output
the necessary metadata.  This was Microsoft's decision:

<quote>The <legacyBold>Hana</legacyBold> presentation is not supported because
its support was already dropped in the latest Sandcastle code before our changes.
The <legacyBold>Prototype</legacyBold> presentation is not supported because we
consider it outdated, existing only for compatibility purposes even in the
earlier Sandcastle version.</quote>

<para>Support for the <legacyBold>Hana</legacyBold> and <legacyBold>Prototype</legacyBold>
styles is present in the help file builder but the Sandcastle transformations and
resource files will need updating in order to support the generation of Microsoft
Help Viewer files with them.  There are no plans to do this and it is recommended that
you switch to the <legacyBold>VS2005</legacyBold> presentation style.</para></listItem>

	<listItem>The Hierarchical TOC plug-in is not compatible with MS Help Viewer output
and there is currently no fix available.  The problem is that the table of contents is
generated off of the help topics when the help viewer file is installed and, since there
are no physical topics for the namespace nodes added to the intermediate table of contents
file by the plug-in, they do not appear in the help file.  Updating the plug-in to support
help viewer output would have required more work than time would allow for this release.
If building other output formats in which you want to use the plug-in, build them
separately from the MS Help Viewer output.</listItem>

	<listItem>The deprecated raw HTML additional content model, site maps, and file system-based
table of contents generation is not supported for help viewer output.  All additional topics
must be in the form of MAML <link xlink:href="3d4edd2d-7883-4508-b9d2-bd7b4d848b0d">conceptual
content</link> and must be defined in a content layout file.  There are too many requirements
of the format to support raw HTML files and the deprecated additional content options.  See the
<token>SandcastleStyles</token> project on CodePlex if you need an HTML to MAML converter utility.</listItem>

	<listItem>Microsoft's Help Viewer Power Tool introduces some changes that are
incompatible with content that uses the <codeInline>SelfBranded=True</codeInline> attribute
as Sandcastle will emit.</listItem>

	<listItem>Microsoft Help Viewer content generated with the <token>SandcastleVersion</token>
release of Sandcastle will produce content that in some contexts produces two vertical
scrollbars.</listItem>

<list class="bullet">
	<listItem>Due to the help formats each loading their own copies of several of the
build components and outputing a separate copy of the HTML output file, there can be a
significant increase in the amount of memory and disk space used during a build that
generates more than one output format. If this is an issue, you may need to build each
help format separately. This issue may be addressed in a future release of the help
file builder with components that are format aware and only need to be loaded once.</listItem>

	<listItem>Not all build errors and warnings have been documented yet.
You will recognize these by a "TODO:" comment where the introduction
should be or in the topic body.  If you need help for one of these errors or
warnings, please ask in the Discussion area of the <token>SHFB</token> project
at CodePlex.</listItem>

	<listItem>The standalone GUI does not support source control providers.</listItem>

	<listItem>Linked items (file items in which the physical file is located in
a folder outside the project's folder) are supported but cannot be added from
the standalone GUI.</listItem>

	<listItem>COM object references are supported in the projects but they
cannot be added from the standalone GUI.</listItem>

	<listItem>Due to their non-standard format, managed C++ projects from Visual
Studio 2008 and before are not currently supported as documentation sources or project
references.  Add the targets and references individually for the time being.</listItem>

	<listItem>The display of editor windows, the Properties window, or the
Preview window sometimes gets corrupted such that the content area disappears
or is not sized correctly in the tabbed area of the UI. Selecting a different
file tab and switching back to the affected tab, closing and reopening the
affected file/window, or resizing the width of a docked window to force a
repaint will work around the issue.</listItem>

	<listItem>Renaming a folder or file in the Project Explorer will not rename
any open document editors associated with the renamed folder or file.  If
necessary, do a <ui>File | Save As</ui> to save it in the right location or
just close and reopen the file if it has not been changed.</listItem>

	<listItem>A standard tree control is used in the Project Explorer window
and does not allow selection of multiple tree nodes.  As such, all operations
within it only affect the currently selected node.</listItem>

	<listItem>When doing search and replace in a text editor window, the
highlight on the found text is not always retained when doing a subsequent
search/replace.  The cursor is positioned correctly though.</listItem>

	<listItem>When using the dropdown on the editor window's "various elements"
toolbar button (shows <ui>alert</ui> as the default action when first opened),
the cursor occassionally disappears from the editor window after the dropdown
closes even though it has the focus and text can be entered.  Change the focus
to another window and back to restore it.</listItem>
