    <introduction>
      <para>Adding a site map file to the project and setting its
<codeInline>BuildAction</codeInline> to <codeInline>SiteMap</codeInline>
allows you to define the table of contents layout for the additional content
HTML files. This allows you to specify a layout that is different than the
physical folder structure of the content files.</para>

<alert class="warning">
	<legacyBold>Deprecated</legacyBold>
	<para>The additional content model of adding extra content to a help file
has been deprecated.  While it will continue to be supported and will not be
removed, it will not receive any more features or updates.  Going forward,
<link xlink:href="3d4edd2d-7883-4508-b9d2-bd7b4d848b0d">conceptual content</link>
is the preferred method of adding non-reference content to the help file.  The
additional content feature can still be used to
<link xlink:href="77d2d693-db84-4ae3-a84c-e33c71f92e9a">override stock content</link>
and add supporting files to the help file.</para>

  <title>The Site Map Editor Window</title>
  <content><para>The structure of the site map file is the same as that used
for ASP.NET web sites but it only makes use of the <codeInline>title</codeInline>
and <codeInline>url</codeInline> attributes on the <codeInline>siteMapNode</codeInline>
elements.  In addition, it adds a custom <codeInline>isDefault</codeInline>
attribute to the default topic element and a custom <codeInline>splitTOC</codeInline>
attribute to the topic where the table of contents should be split with API
topics appearing above it.  For more information on the structure of site map
files, see the MSDN <externalLink><linkText>ASP.NET Site Maps</linkText>
<linkUri>http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yy2ykkab.aspx</linkUri>
<linkTarget>_blank</linkTarget></externalLink> topic.  You can edit the site
map file from within the help file builder by double-clicking it in the Project
Explorer window or by selecting the <ui>Open</ui> option from its context menu.
The site map editor window is shown below.</para>

<mediaLink><image xlink:href="SiteMapEditor" placement="center" /></mediaLink>

	<para>The top part of the window shows the table of contents as it is
currently defined.  Entries can be arranged hierarchically to any number of
levels.  The bottom part of the form shows the properties for the currently
selected entry.  You can modify the topic's details at any time.  Changes are
stored automatically before moving off to another topic in the tree.  Files
defined in the site map do not have to appear as additional content items in
the project.  Any files in the site map that are not found in the defined
additional content items at build time are copied over to the root output
folder automatically.</para>

	<para>The tree supports drag and drop to re-order the topics.  Simply click
and hold the left mouse button on a topic and then drag it to its new location.
When you drop it on a topic, it is inserted immediately after the target item.
If you hold down the <ui>Shift</ui> key while dropping an item, it will become
a child of the target item.</para>

<alert class="tip">
  <para>Dragging a topic from the site map editor and dropping it into an
editor window containing an HTML file will create a link to the item in the
topic that is being edited.  When dropped in other file types, the topic's
title is inserted into the file.</para>

<section address="Commands">
  <title>Available Commands</title>
  <content>
	<para>The toolbar above the tree is used to add, delete, and re-order
the topics.  These options are also available in a context menu accessed by
right clicking within the tree control.  The commands (from left to right)
and their associated context menu options perform the following actions:</para>

<definitionTable>
  <definedTerm>Mark as Default Topic</definedTerm>
  <definition>This will mark the selected topic as the default topic for the
help file.  The default topic option acts as a toggle.  Click it once on a
topic to set it as the default.  Clicking it again on the same topic turns it
off and no topic will be selected as the default topic.  In such cases, the
root namespaces page will be the default topic for the help file.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Split Table of Contents</definedTerm>
  <definition>This is used to indicate that the table of contents should be
split by the API content.  It is only valid on table of contents entries that
appear at the root level.  All table of contents entries prior to the entry with
this marker will appear before the API content.  The entry with the marker and
all entries following it will appear after the API content.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Move Up</definedTerm>
  <definition>This will move the selected topic up in the order of topics at
the same level as the selected topic.  Note that moving a topic will also move
its sub-topics.  Sub-topics will still remain in their given order below the
parent topic.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Move Down</definedTerm>
  <definition>This will move the selected topic down in the order of topics at
the same level as the selected topic.  Note that moving a topic will also move
its sub-topics.  Sub-topics will still remain in their given order below the
parent topic.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Add Sibling Topic</definedTerm>
  <definition><para>This will add a new topic at the same level as the
currently selected topic.  The sub-options for this command allow you to add a
new topic file, add an existing topic file, add all topic files from an
existing folder, or add an empty container node.</para>

<alert class="note">
  <para>Adding a topic to the site map will automatically add its related file
to the project if it is not already there.  Adding all files from a folder will
add all topic files found recursively.  The folder structure will be duplicated
in the table of contents layout.</para>
</alert></definition>

  <definedTerm>Add Child Topic</definedTerm>
  <definition>This will add a new topic as a child of the currently selected
topic.  The sub-options for this command allow you to add a new topic file, add
an existing topic file, add all topic files from an existing folder, or add an
empty container node.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Delete</definedTerm>
  <definition><para>Delete the selected topic and all of its sub-topics.</para>

<alert class="note">
  <para>Deleting a topic from the site map will not delete its related file
from the project.  Use the <ui>Project Explorer</ui> to physically delete the
file from the project and the file system.</para>
</alert></definition>

  <definedTerm>Cut</definedTerm>
  <definition>Cut the selected topic and its sub-topics to the clipboard.  A
copy of the topic is made and it is then removed from the tree.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Paste</definedTerm>
  <definition>If a topic has been cut to the clipboard, you can click the
<ui>Paste</ui> button to add it to the tree.  If you just click the
button, the topic is added as a sibling of the currently selected topic
immediately following it.  If you select the <ui>Paste as Child</ui> sub-option,
the topic is inserted as a child of the selected topic.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Edit File</definedTerm>
  <definition>Edit the selected content file.  Double-clicking a topic in the
tree will also open it for editing.</definition>

</definitionTable>

	<para>The context menu for topics also contains the following additional
options:</para>

<definitionTable>
  <definedTerm>Copy as Topic Link</definedTerm>
  <definition>Copy a link to the topic to the clipboard.  If pasted into an
HTML file, an anchor element is inserted that will link to the selected topic.
If pasted into any other file type, the topic's title is pasted into the file.</definition>

  <definedTerm>Sort Topics</definedTerm>
  <definition>Sort the topics alphabetically by title within the currently
selected topic's group.</definition>
