      <para>This walkthrough will guide you through creating your first help
file builder project.</para>
    </introduction>

    <prerequisites><content>Before creating a help file builder project, be
sure that you have installed all of the
<link xlink:href="8c0c97d0-c968-4c15-9fe9-e8f3a443c50a">necessary tools</link>
and that you have
<link xlink:href="c47d9242-b3a8-4153-aa9e-ae8cb41cefe2">enabled XML comments</link>
in your project and added some comments to your code.</content></prerequisites>

                <para>In the <ui>Save As</ui> dialog box, select the folder
in which to save the new project and enter its name.  Click <ui>Save</ui> to
create the new project.  Once done, the

and the <link xlink:href="e32086c6-de17-4e54-a746-1ac80bf0c45a" />
will be opened for you.</para>

            </step>
            <step>
              <content>
                <para>Ignore the properties window for now and right click on
the <ui>Documentation Sources</ui> node in the Project Explorer.  In the
context menu, select <ui>Add Documentation Source</ui>.  A <newTerm>documentation
source</newTerm> is a file such as an assembly or a Visual Studio solution or
project from which information will be extracted to produce API documentation.
For this demo, navigate to the help file builder folder and select the
<localUri>SandcastleBuilder.Components.dll</localUri> assembly.</para>

<alert class="tip">
  <para>When selecting either an assembly or an XML comments file, the help
file builder will automatically add the partner file for you (i.e. the XML
comments file for the like-named assembly or the assembly for the like-named
comments file).  Multiple files can also be selected and added in one go or
dragged from Windows Explorer and dropped on the Documentation Sources node.</para>

            <step>
              <content>
                <para>Now we will add a reference assembly to the project.
<newTerm>References</newTerm> are assemblies that are dependencies of one or
more of the documentation source assemblies.  They contain information necessary
to create inherited member information for the documented classes but that are
themselves not wanted in the API documentation.  Right click on the
<ui>References</ui> node and select <ui>Add File/Project Reference</ui>.
For this example, navigate to the help file builder folder and select the
<localUri>ColorizerLibrary.dll</localUri>.</para>

            <step>
              <content>
                <para>You are now ready to build a basic help file.  Select
<ui>Documentation | Build Project</ui> to do so.  The help file builder will
open the <ui>Output Window</ui> and start displaying the messages from the
build process.  Depending on the number of documentation sources, the number
of types and members in them, and some other factors, this can take several
minutes or, in extremely large projects, several hours.</para>

			<alert class="tip">
				<para>All build warnings and errors are reported with a code
value.  You can look these values up in the <link xlink:href="46d1f76e-a97e-4ee6-971c-fdeab725ff09" />
section of the help file for information about what they mean and possible
solutions to fix the problem.</para>
			</alert>

			<alert class="note">
			  <para>The build process can consume a lot of memory and, if your
system has less than 1GB, it may take much more time to complete a build.
Another factor that can affect the build time are the <codeInline>HtmlSdkLinkType</codeInline>
<codeInline>MSHelp2SdkLinkType</codeInline>, <codeInline>MSHelpViewerSdkLinkType</codeInline>,
and <codeInline>WebsiteSdkLinkType</codeInline> project property settings.  By
default, they are all set to <codeInline>Msdn</codeInline> which causes the
<application>BuildAssembler</application> tool to contact the MSDN web service
to resolve links to online content for all .NET Framework types and members.
If your internet connection is slow, the resulting build will take longer.
See the documentation for the above noted SDK link type properties for information
on their possible values and the <link xlink:href="3a1c4bf1-8ecf-4ab3-8010-277bed8d3819">cached
build components</link> topic for information on how you can reduce the build time.</para>

<alert class="note">
  <para>When the SDK link type properties are set to <codeInline>Msdn</codeInline>,
the build may fail if you are behind a proxy server.  See the
<link xlink:href="1aea789d-b226-4b39-b534-4c97c256fac8#Proxy">FAQ</link> for the
workaround.</para>

              <content>
                <para>Once the build process finishes, you can select the
<ui>Documentation | View Help File</ui> menu option to view the help file.
The default <ui>View Help File</ui> option displays the help format based on
which type or types where built (Help 1, Help 2, or website).  You can also
select a specific help format to view if multiple formats were built as
determined by the <codeInline>HelpFileFormat</codeInline> project property.</para>

				<alert class="note">
				  <para>In order to view MS Help 2 files, a separate viewer
application is required and must be defined in the
<link xlink:href="2152ed96-bf69-4b9b-b1a7-4fffc71b3095" />.  See the
<link xlink:href="8c0c97d0-c968-4c15-9fe9-e8f3a443c50a" /> for information on
how to obtain one.</para>
