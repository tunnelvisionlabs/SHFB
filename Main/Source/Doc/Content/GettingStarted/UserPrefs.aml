    <introduction>
      <para>The <ui>User Preferences</ui> option on the <ui>File</ui> menu
allows you to set some common non-project application settings.  The dialog box
contains two tabs.  The first is for general preferences and the second is for
defining custom content editors for project files.</para>
    </introduction>

<section>
  <title>General Preferences</title>
  <content><para>The general preferences are as follows:</para>

<list class="bullet">
    <listItem><ui>MS Help 2 (.HxS) Viewer Path</ui> - This allows you to specify
the path to an external application that can be used to view MS Help 2 (.HxS)
files.  If you need one, see the
<link xlink:href="8c0c97d0-c968-4c15-9fe9-e8f3a443c50a" /> for the download
location of the <application>H2 Viewer</application>.</listItem>

    <listItem><ui>MS Help Viewer (.mshc) Viewer Path</ui> - This allows you to
specify the path to an external application that can be used to view MS Help Viewer
(.mshc) files.  If you need one, see the
<link xlink:href="8c0c97d0-c968-4c15-9fe9-e8f3a443c50a" /> for the download
location of the <application>H3 Viewer</application>.  If not specified, the
default browser will be used to open MS Help Viewer content.</listItem>

    <listItem><ui>ASP.NET Development Web Server Port</ui> - This allows you to
specify the port number to use when starting the built-in .NET 2.0 development
web server to view website output using the <localUri>Index.aspx</localUri>
page.  By default, it is set to port 12345.  You can alter this if it conflicts
with something on your system.</listItem>

	<listItem><ui>Save window state per project for each user</ui> - This allows you to save the current window layout
and currently open file editors when a project is closed.  The window state is saved to the same folder as the
project using the project filename with a "<localUri>_[USERNAME]</localUri>" suffix where
<codeInline>USERNAME</codeInline> is the user ID of the currently logged in user.  If turned off,
only the location of the Project Explorer and Project Properties window are saved in the
general user preferences.</listItem>

	<listItem><ui>Before Building</ui> - This lets you specify whether or not
the help file builder should save the project and/or modified document windows
prior to performing a build or previewing a topic.  The options are:

	<list class="bullet">
		<listItem>Save all changes - Save the project and any modified document
editors.</listItem>
		<listItem>Save changes to open documents only - Only open, modified
document editors are saved.  Changes to the project file are not saved.</listItem>
		<listItem>Prompt to save all changes - You will be asked to save all
changes.  If documents are not saved, the resulting help file may not contain
current information.</listItem>
		<listItem>Don't save any changes - Nothing is saved.  The resulting
help file may not contain current information if there are unsaved documents.</listItem>
	</list>

<alert class="note">
  <para>When opening the topic preview window, the previewed document is always
saved regardless of this setting so that it shows current information.</para>
</alert></listItem>

    <listItem><ui>Build window verbose logging enabled</ui> - This allows you
to specify whether or not full logging information is displayed in the output
window during a build.  It is checked by default.  If unchecked, only build
step messages are reported during the build.  All messages are still written to
the log file.  This is useful for very large projects where the generated
output can consume large quantities of memory.</listItem>

	<listItem><ui>Open help file after successful build</ui> - If enabled, the
help file will be opened after a successful build.  The format opened will
depend on the format chosen in the <codeInline>HelpFileFormat</codeInline>
project property.  Preference is given to Help 1, then Help 2, and finally
website output.  This option can also be toggled on and off via the
<ui>Documentation | View Help File</ui> menu.</listItem>

	<listItem><ui>Build Output Background/Foreground/Font</ui> - These options
let you specify the background color, foreground color, and font used in the
output window for the build output (the text shown during the build).</listItem>

	<listItem><ui>Text Editor Font</ui> - This option lets you set the font
used in the text editor windows.  The syntax highlighter controls the colors
and they are not editable.</listItem>

	<listItem><ui>Show line numbers in text editor</ui> - If enabled, all
text editor windows will show line numbers down the left side.  If not enabled,
no line numbers are shown within the text editor windows.</listItem>

	<listItem><ui>Enter matching brackets, parentheses, and quotes</ui> - If
enabled, all editor windows will automatically insert the matching closing
character when an opening bracket, parentheses, or double quote is entered.  If
not enabled, the matching character is not entered automatically.</listItem>

</list>

<section>
  <title>Content File Editors</title>
  <content><para>This tab allows you to define custom editors for project files
that are not recognized by the standalone GUI as being editable text files
based on their filename extension.  In such cases, the GUI will look for a
custom editor definition and, if found, will launch the associated application.
If no custom editor definition is found, the GUI attempts to launch the file
using the shell to let it decide how the file should be edited.</para>

	<para>To add a new content file editor, click the <ui>Add</ui> button
located next to the upper right corner of the editor list.  Select the new
entry in the list and use the property grid at the bottom of the tab to alter
its settings.</para>

<list class="bullet">
    <listItem><ui>Description</ui> - Enter a description for the editor.</listItem>

    <listItem><ui>Extensions</ui> - Enter a list of filename extensions with
which this editor will be associated.  If specifying multiple extensions,
separate them with a space, semi-colon, period, or a comma.</listItem>

    <listItem><ui>ApplicationPath</ui> - Enter the path to the editor
application.  As with other project properties, this can be an absolute or a
relative path and can contain environment variable references for expansion
when actually invoked.</listItem>

    <listItem><para><ui>Arguments</ui> - Specify any necessary command line
arguments.  At the minimum, the <codeInline>$ContentItem</codeInline> macro
should be specified so that the file to edit is passed to the application.
Enclose arguments in quote marks if the value will contain spaces.  Macros that
you can use are as follows:</para>

    <list class="bullet">
        <listItem><codeInline>$ContentItem</codeInline> - This expands to the
full path and filename of the item to be edited.</listItem>
        <listItem><codeInline>$ProjectFile</codeInline> - This expands to the
full path and filename of the current project.</listItem>
        <listItem><codeInline>$ProjectFolder</codeInline> - This expands to the
full path of the current project without the filename.</listItem>
    </list>

	<para>Macro names are case-insensitive.</para></listItem>

    <listItem><ui>StartupFolder</ui> - An optional folder name in which the
application is started.  If left blank, the current project's folder is used.
As with the application path, this can be an absolute or relative path and can
contain environment variable references for expansion when actually invoked.</listItem>

</list>

	<para>To delete an editor definition, select it in the list and click the
<ui>Delete</ui> button located next to the bottom right corner of the editor
list.</para>
