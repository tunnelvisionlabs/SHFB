      <content>
        <para>If you have been modifying the help file project by hand rather
than by using the help file builder standalone GUI, back out your changes and
try to reload the project.  If you have not made any such modifications, open
a work item in the <token>SHFB</token> project at CodePlex containing the
details from the error message.  Attach the affected project as an example.</para>
