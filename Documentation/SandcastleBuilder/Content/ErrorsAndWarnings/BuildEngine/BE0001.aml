			<title>Solution</title>
			<content>
				<para>The most likely cause for this error is that a custom presentation style was selected but the
build engine could not find the presentation style definition.  The standard presentation style definitions are
found in the <localUri>StandardStyles.presentation</localUri> file located in the help file builder installation
folder.  Custom presentation styles are typically located in the <localUri>.\Presentation Styles</localUri>
sub-folder under the <legacyBold>Common Application Data</legacyBold> folder.  See the
