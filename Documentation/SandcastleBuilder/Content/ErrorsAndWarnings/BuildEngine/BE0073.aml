        <para>A project documentation source specified a later framework version than the one found in the help
file builder project.  The build engine was unable to locate framework information for that later version and an
attempt was made to redirect usage to a later version but none were found.</para>

      <content>
        <para>This can happen if you add a project documentation source that uses a later framework version than
the one defined in the help file builder project and it is not installed on the system.  For example, the
documentation source project specifies Silverlight 5 but the help file builder project specified Silverlight 4.
If the later version is not found, the build engine will attempt to redirect usage to a later version of the
framework if one can be found on the system.  If the specified version or a later version cannot be found, you
will need to install the selected or later version of the framework specified in the project on the system.</para>
