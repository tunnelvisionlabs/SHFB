      <content>
        <para>The build engine was unable to locate framework information for the version specified in the
project's <codeInline>FrameworkVersion</codeInline> property.  An attempt was made to redirect usage to a later
version but none were found.</para>

      <content>
        <para>This can happen if you select a framework that is not installed on the system.  For example,
choosing an earlier version of the Silverlight framework.  If the earlier version is not found, the build engine
will attempt to redirect usage to a later version of the framework if one can be found on the system.  If the
specified version or a later version cannot be found, you will need to install the selected or later version of
the framework specified in the project on the system.</para>
