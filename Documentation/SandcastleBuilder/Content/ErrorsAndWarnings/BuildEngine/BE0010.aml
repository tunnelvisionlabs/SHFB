      <para>Warning BE0010: Image file '<localUri>[imageFile]</localUri>'
already exists.  It will be replaced by '<localUri>[duplicateFile]</localUri>'.</para>

      <title>Cause</title>
      <content>
        <para>This warning occurs if two conceptual content media files with
the same filename but from different source locations are copied to the
<localUri>.\Media</localUri> folder during the build.</para>
      </content>

    <section>
      <title>Solution</title>
      <content>
        <para>Although source image files with the same name can reside in
different project folders, all conceptual content images are copied to the
<localUri>.\Media</localUri> folder during the build.  As such, like-named
files will overwrite each other.  If this is an issue, rename one of the files.
The image IDs should remain the same or you will have to locate their
occurrences in the topics and update them manually.</para>
