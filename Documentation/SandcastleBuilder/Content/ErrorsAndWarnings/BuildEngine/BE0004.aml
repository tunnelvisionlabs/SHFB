      <para>Error BE0004: MRefBuilder has a version of
'<legacyItalic>[installedVersion]</legacyItalic>' but version
'<legacyItalic>[expectedVersion]</legacyItalic>' was expected.  You need
to update your copy of the help file builder.</para>

      <content>
        <para>This error occurs when the version of the Microsoft Sandcastle
documentation tools found is more recent than the one the help file builder
was expecting.  Due to dependencies in some of the help file builder components
on components in the prior Sandcastle release, the build cannot complete successfully.</para>

        <para>The following information can help solve this problem:</para>

<list class="bullet">
  <listItem>Review the <link xlink:href="8c0c97d0-c968-4c15-9fe9-e8f3a443c50a" />
carefully and make sure that you have installed all of the required tools and
have the latest version of each.  Most importantly, check the <token>SHFB</token>
project site for an updated release of the help file builder that is compatible
with the most recent release of the Sandcastle tools.</listItem>

  <listItem>Check to be sure that a system copy of the
<environmentVariable>DXROOT</environmentVariable> environment variable exists
and that it points to the most recent copy of Sandcastle (usually
<localUri>C:\Program Files\Sandcastle</localUri>).  In addition, make sure that
there is no user copy of the <environmentVariable>DXROOT</environmentVariable>
environment variable.  If one does exist, delete it.</listItem>

  <listItem>If the Sandcastle folder exists in the <environmentVariable>PATH</environmentVariable>
environment variable, ensure that it is correct.  Preference is given to the
<environmentVariable>DXROOT</environmentVariable> variable so this is not a
requirement unless the <environmentVariable>DXROOT</environmentVariable> value
is wrong.</listItem>

  <listItem>If all else fails, manually specify the location of the Sandcastle
tools by entering the path in the <codeInline>SandcastlePath</codeInline>
project property.  This usually needs to be done if performing the build on
a build server.</listItem>
</list>

<alert class="note">
  <para>In all cases above, be sure to specify the path to the Sandcastle tools
from Microsoft, <legacyBold>NOT</legacyBold> the path to the help file builder.</para>
