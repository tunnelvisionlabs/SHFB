        <para>In order to be built correctly, the selected presentation style must support all of the selected
help file output formats.  Certain styles may be written for a specific help file formats or, as in the case of
the Prototype and Hana styles, have been deprecated and have not been updated to support later file formats such
as MS Help Viewer.  Either unselect the unsupported format(s) or choose a different presentation style that does
support the selected format(s).</para>
