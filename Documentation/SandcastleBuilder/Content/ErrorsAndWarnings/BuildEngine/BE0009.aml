    <introduction>
      <para>Warning BE0009: '<legacyItalic>[memberId]</legacyItalic>' is marked
with <codeInline>&lt;exclude /&gt;</codeInline> but conflicted with the API
filter setting.  Exclusion ignored.</para>
    </introduction>

    <section>
      <title>Cause</title>
      <content>
        <para>This warning occurs if the indicated API member has an
<codeInline>&lt;exclude /&gt;</codeInline> tag in its XML comments but the
<codeInline>ApiFilter</codeInline> project property explicitly marks it as
included.  In such cases, the API filter wins and the member is included in
the help file.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Solution</title>
      <content>
        <para>This situation can occur if the member was previously included
explicitly in the API filter and the <codeInline>&lt;exclude /&gt;</codeInline>
tag was added to its comments at a later date.  In order to fix this issue,
remove the <codeInline>&lt;exclude /&gt;</codeInline> tag from the member's
comments and, if not wanted, mark it as excluded in the help project's
<codeInline>ApiFilter</codeInline> property.</para>
