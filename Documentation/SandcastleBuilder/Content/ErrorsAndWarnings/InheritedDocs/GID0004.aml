        <para>The possible causes for this warning are as follows:</para>
        
<list class="bullet">
  <listItem>The indicated ID name is misspelled or does not exist.  In this,
case, you must correct the ID so that it refers to a valid member ID.</listItem>

  <listItem>The member does not represent an item from which comments can be
inherited (i.e. not a class, an interface member, a virtual member, etc.).</listItem>

  <listItem>The member's base elements do not contain comments.  In this case,
you must add comments on the base members so that they can be inherited.</listItem>

  <listItem>If you specified a <codeInline>cref</codeInline> and/or a
<codeInline>select</codeInline> attribute check them to make sure that they are
accurate and will result in member comments that can be inherited.</listItem>
