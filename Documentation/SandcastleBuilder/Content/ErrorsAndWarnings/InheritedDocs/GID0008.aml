    <introduction>
      <para>Warning GID0008: Entries for the key '<legacyItalic>[id]</legacyItalic>'
occur in both '<localUri>[file1]</localUri>' and '<localUri>[file2]</localUri>'.
The entries in '<localUri>[file2]</localUri>' will be used.</para>

      <content>
        <para>This warning occurs if a member ID occurs in more than one
comments file.  In such cases, the ID and its related comments from the
second file will be used rather than those in the first file.</para>

      <content>
        <para>This warning can usually be safely ignored as it simply means
that a subsequent comments file is overriding the comments for the given ID
with an alternate set of comments.  This can happen frequently in the base
.NET Framework classes.  If the second set of comments used are not appropriate,
you may need to take steps to rearrrange the files, remove the duplicate set
of comments, or supply an additional file that further overrides the comments.</para>
