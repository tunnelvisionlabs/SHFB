'<legacyItalic>[nestedElement]</legacyItalic>'

				<para>No inheritable comments were found for the nested comment element of the indicated member ID.</para>

			<content>
				<para>The possible causes for this warning are as follows:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>The indicated ID name is misspelled or does not exist.  In this, case, you must correct the ID
so that it refers to a valid member ID.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The member does not represent an item from which comments can be inherited (i.e. not a class,
an interface member, a virtual member, etc.).</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The member's base elements do not contain comments.  In this case, you must add comments on
the base members so that they can be inherited.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>If you specified a <codeInline>cref</codeInline> and/or a <codeInline>select</codeInline>
attribute check them to make sure that they are accurate and will result in member comments that can be
inherited.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>If the <legacyItalic>[nestedElement]</legacyItalic> part of the message is "[Base member from
reference assembly not included for documentation]", it means that the identified member tried to inherit
documentation from a base class that is in a reference assembly.  You can resolve this problem by using the
<legacyBold>Additional Reference Links</legacyBold> plug-in to add reference information for the assembly.
Be sure to include the reference assembly's XML comments file in the main project so that the inherited
documentation can be found.</para>
