      <para>The MS Help Viewer system maintains a catalog of all help packages currently installed on a machine.
This catalog determines what books are included in each package as well as maintaining references between the
packages.  More information can be found on the <externalLink><linkText>Introducing MS Help Viewer 1.0</linkText>

<section>
  <content>
		<para>Unlike HTML Help 1 (CHM) files, an MS Help Viewer package or book must be installed in order to view
it. This makes deploying MS Help Viewer documentation more complex than simply delivering a single file and
creating a shortcut to it.  However, it is much simpler than its predecessor, MS Help 2.</para>

<alert class="tip">
  <para>Due to the requirement that MS Help Viewer files be installed before you can view them which can be time
consuming, it is recommended that you generate one of the other help formats such as Help 1 or website while
developing and proofreading your help file.</para>
</alert>

		<para>When producing an MS Help Viewer file, the help file builder produces a valid help content setup file
suitable for use by the Help Library Manager.  It also includes a Help Library Manager launcher utility that
takes care of the standard housekeeping tasks required when installing and removing MS Help Viewer content.  It
is a command line tool that can be included by scripted installers as well as Windows Installer packages as a
custom action.  In order to deploy the generated MS Help Viewer file, follow these steps:</para>

		<list class="ordered">
			<listItem>
				<para>Set the MS Help Viewer <link xlink:href="5f743a6e-3239-409a-a8c1-0bff4b5375f4"> project properties</link>
as needed.  At the minimum, you should set the <codeInline>Vendor Name</codeInline> and <codeInline>Product Title</codeInline>
properties to something other than their default values.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>Build the help project.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>In order to install an MS Help Viewer file, a help content setup file is required.  The help file
builder automatically creates a help content setup file for you named after the help file but with a
<localUri>.msha</localUri> extension.  This allows you to build and deploy multiple MS Help Viewer files to the
same location.</para>

				<alert class="important">
					<para>For MS Help Viewer 1.0, the name of the help content setup file used during installation must be
<localUri>HelpContentSetup.msha</localUri>.  If you only have one help file, you can rename the setup file
created by the help file builder to <localUri>HelpContentSetup.msha</localUri>.  If you have multiple help
files, you can rename one of the setup files and merge the package information from the others into it.</para>
				</alert>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>Include all of the generated help files (the <localUri>.mshc</localUri> files) as well as the
<localUri>HelpContentSetup.msha</localUri> and the <localUri>HelpLibraryManagerLauncher.exe</localUri> executable
in your installer.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>During installation, copy the help files, the help content setup file, and
<localUri>HelpLibraryManagerLauncher.exe</localUri> to their installed location.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para>Execute the <link xlink:href="534c4ff1-3bba-4431-a3a6-76dcb2d374f8">Help Library Manager launcher</link>
or a script to install the help file.  This step will vary based on whether or not you are using signed cabinet
files to deploy your help content.  Note that silent installs are only allowed with signed cabinet files.  For
unsigned files, the Help Library Manager will always appear and confirm the installation.  Below is an example of
the script that the help file builder creates to install the help file  (lines wrapped for display purposes).</para>

REM Launcher to install an MS Help Viewer file.  You can use this as an example
REM for creating a script to run from your product's installer.

REM NOTE: If not executed from within the same folder as the executable, a full
REM path is required on the executable and the HelpContentSetup.msha file.

REM Help Viewer 1.0
REM Uninstall first in case it is already there.  If not, it won't install

REM For Help Viewer 1.0. the setup name must be HelpContentSetup.msha so make
REM sure we copy the setup file to that name.  SHFB names it after the help
REM file so that multiple files can be deployed to the same output older at
REM build time.
