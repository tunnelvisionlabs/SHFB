      <para>The MS Help Viewer system maintains a catalog of all help packages
currently installed on a machine.  This catalog determines what books are included
in each package as well as maintaining references between the packages.  More
information can be found on the <externalLink><linkText>Introducing MS Help Viewer 1.0</linkText>

<section>
  <content><para>Unlike HTML Help 1 (CHM) files, an MS Help Viewer package or
book must be installed in order to view it. This makes deploying MS Help
Viewer documentation more complex than simply delivering a single file and
creating a shortcut to it.  However, it is much simpler than its predecessor, MS
Help 2.</para>

<alert class="tip">
  <para>Due to the requirement that MS Help Viewer files be installed before you can
view them which can be time consuming, it is recommended that you generate one of the
other help formats such as Help 1 or website while developing and proofreading your
help file.</para>
</alert>

<para>When producing an MS Help Viewer file, the help file builder produces a
valid help content setup file suitable for use by the Help Library Manager.  It
also includes a Help Library Manager launcher utility that takes care of the
standard housekeeping tasks required when installing and removing MS Help Viewer
content.  It is a command line tool that can be included by scripted installers
as well as Windows Installer packages as a custom action.  In order to deploy the
generated MS Help Viewer file, follow these steps:</para>

<list class="ordered">
    <listItem>Set the MS Help Viewer <link xlink:href="5f743a6e-3239-409a-a8c1-0bff4b5375f4">project
properties</link> as needed.  At the minimum, you should set the <codeInline>VendorName</codeInline>
and <codeInline>ProductTitle</codeInline> properties to something other than their default values.</listItem>

    <listItem>Build the help project.</listItem>
    
    <listItem><para>In order to install an MS Help Viewer file, a help content setup
file is required.  The help file builder automatically creates a help content setup
file for you named after the help file but with a <localUri>.msha</localUri> extension.
This allows you to build and deploy multiple MS Help Viewer files to the same location.</para>

<alert class="important">
  <para>The name of the help content setup file used during installation must be
<localUri>HelpContentSetup.msha</localUri>.  If you only have one help file, you can
rename the setup file created by the help file builder to <localUri>HelpContentSetup.msha</localUri>.
If you have multiple help files, you can rename one of the setup files and merge the package
information from the others into it.</para>
</alert></listItem>

    <listItem>Include all of the generated help files (the <localUri>.mshc</localUri>
files) as well as the <localUri>HelpContentSetup.msha</localUri> and the 
<localUri>HelpLibraryManagerLauncher.exe</localUri> executable in your installer.</listItem>

    <listItem>During installation, copy the help files, the help content setup
file, and <localUri>HelpLibraryManagerLauncher.exe</localUri> to their installed location.</listItem>

    <listItem><para>Execute the <link xlink:href="534c4ff1-3bba-4431-a3a6-76dcb2d374f8">Help
Library Manager launcher</link> or a script to install the help file.  This step will
vary based on whether or not you are using signed cabinet files to deploy your help
content.  Note that silent installs are only allowed with signed cabinet files.  For
unsigned files, the Help Library Manager will always appear and confirm the installation.
Below is an example of the script that the help file builder creates to install the
help file  (lines wrapped for display purposes).</para>

<code lang="none" title=" ">
@ECHO OFF
CLS

REM This is an example script to show how to use the Help Library Manager
REM Launcher to install an MS Help Viewer file.  You can use this as an example
REM for creating a script to run from your product's installer.

REM NOTE: If not executed from within the same folder as the executable, a
REM full path is required on the executable and the HelpContentSetup.msha file.

REM Uninstall first in case it is already there.  If not, it won't install
REM below.  We'll ignore output by redirecting it to NUL.
HelpLibraryManagerLauncher.exe /product "VS" /version "100" /locale en-us
  /uninstall /silent /vendor "EWSoftware"
  /mediaBookList "Sandcastle Standalone Build Components"
  /productName "Sandcastle Help File Builder" > NUL

REM Install the new content.
HelpLibraryManagerLauncher.exe /product "VS" /version "100" /locale en-us
  /brandingPackage Dev10.mshc /sourceMedia HelpContentSetup.msha

</listItem>

    <listItem><para>During uninstallation, before the help files are removed, execute
the Help Library Manager launcher to uninstall your help file.  Below is an example of
the script that the help file builder creates to remove the help file  (lines
wrapped for display purposes).</para>

REM This is an example script to show how to use the Help Library Manager
REM Launcher to remove an MS Help Viewer file.  You can use this as an example
REM for creating a script to run from your product's uninstaller.

<para>Your product's installer can create a shortcut to open your Help Viewer file
by executing the following command (lines wrapped for display purposes):</para>
