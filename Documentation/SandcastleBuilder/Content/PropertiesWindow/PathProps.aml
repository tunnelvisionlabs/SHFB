		<section address="HHCPath">
			<title>HTML Help 1 compiler path (HtmlHelp1xCompilerPath)</title>
			<content>
				<para>This property lets you specify the path to the HTML Help 1 compiler (<localUri>HHC.EXE</localUri>).
By default, the builder will try to locate it automatically by searching the <localUri>Program Files</localUri>
special folder on all fixed hard drives.  As such, you only need to specify the path if the build fails with a
message stating that it could not be found.</para>

			</content>

		<section address="HXCompPath">
			<title>MS Help 2 compiler path (HtmlHelp2xCompilerPath)</title>
			<content>
				<para>This property lets you specify the path to the MS Help 2 compiler (<localUri>HXCOMP.EXE</localUri>).
By default, the builder will try to locate it automatically by searching the <localUri>Program Files</localUri>
special folder on all fixed hard drives.  As such, you only need to specify the path if the build fails with a
message stating that it could not be found.</para>
			</content>
		</section>

		<section address="ComponentPath">
			<title>Project-specific components path (ComponentPath)</title>
			<content>
				<para>This property lets you specify the path where the help file builder can find custom build
components, plug-ins, syntax generators, and presentation styles specific to the project.  If left blank, the
project's folder is searched instead.  This is useful for XCOPY deployments or when developing build components
so that they don't have to be installed in the standard location (the common application data folder).</para>

			</content>
		</section>

		<section address="OutputPath">
			<title>Help content output path (OutputPath)</title>
			<content>
				<para>This property lets you specify where the compiled help file should be placed.  The default is to
store it in a folder called <localUri>.\Help\</localUri> relative to the project folder.  It is also the location
of the temporary <localUri>.\Working\</localUri> folder used to store the generated build files unless it is
changed with the <codeInline>Working Path</codeInline> property.  This property cannot be set to the same value
as the <codeInline>Working Path</codeInline> property as the working path folder is cleared prior to the build.</para>

				<alert class="warning">
					<para>Be aware that if an option is selected that produces a website, the output folder specified by
the <codeInline>Output Path</codeInline> property will be cleared of all of its current content without any
prompting before the web site content is copied to it.  In other words, don't do something stupid like set it to
the root of your C: drive or your desktop folder.    The help file builder will try to take steps to ensure this
does not happen.  When producing Help 1, Help 2, and/or MS Help Viewer files, the output folder is not cleared.</para>
				</alert>

		<section address="WorkingPath">
			<title>Working files path (WorkingPath)</title>
			<content>
				<para>This property lets you specify an alternate location with a shorter path in which to perform the
build if it fails due to long file path names.  If not specified, the working folder will be placed under the
output path and will be called <localUri>.\Working</localUri>.  This property cannot be set to the same value as
the <codeInline>Output Path</codeInline> property as the working path folder is cleared prior to the build.</para>

				<alert class="warning">
					<para>Be aware that the working folder specified by the <codeInline>Working Path</codeInline> property
will be cleared of all of its current content without any prompting before the build begins.  In other words,
don't do something stupid like set it to the root of your C: drive or your desktop folder.  The help file builder
will try to take steps to ensure this does not happen.</para>
