    <introduction>
      <para>The following properties are available in the Show Missing Tags
category.  These define for which help topic elements a red "missing" message
will appear if the related tag has not been used where needed or contains no
text.  These can help you locate help topics that need additional work to fully
specify the documentation.  In addition to the inserted messages, a warning is
written to the log file noting the missing item as well.</para>

<alert class="tip">
  <para>You can simplify your project comments for derived classes, interface
implementations, overridden members, and other members with other common
comments by making use of the

<section address="AutoDocCtors">
  <title>AutoDocumentConstructors</title>
  <content><para>This is used to indicate whether or not constructors are
automatically documented if they are missing the <codeInline>&lt;summary&gt;</codeInline>
tag and for classes with compiler-generated constructors. Set this to True (the
default) to automatically add default text for the <codeInline>&lt;summary&gt;</codeInline>
tag on constructors that are missing it and for classes with a
compiler-generated constructor. If set to false and
<codeInline>ShowMissingSummaries</codeInline> is true, a "missing summary"
warning will appear instead.  A message is also written to the log file when a
constructor is auto-documented.</para>

<section address="AutoDocDispose">
  <title>AutoDocumentDisposeMethods</title>
  <content><para>This is used to indicate whether or not dispose methods are
automatically documented if they are missing the <codeInline>&lt;summary&gt;</codeInline>
tag and for classes with compiler-generated dispose methods. Set this to True (the
default) to automatically add default text for the <codeInline>&lt;summary&gt;</codeInline>
tag on dispose methods that are missing it and for classes with compiler-generated
dispose methods. If set to false and <codeInline>ShowMissingSummaries</codeInline>
is true, a "missing summary" warning will appear instead.  A message is also
written to the log file when a dispose method is auto-documented.  If a
<codeInline>Dispose(Boolean)</codeInline> method is present, its parameter will
also be auto-documented if necessary.  If set to false and
<codeInline>ShowMissingParams</codeInline> is true, a "missing parameter"
message will appear instead.</para>

<section address="MissingIncTargets">
  <title>ShowMissingIncludeTargets</title>
  <content><para>This property lets you indicate whether or not a red "missing"
message is inserted into each topic in which an <codeInline>include</codeInline>
tag is found.  This indicates that the target of the include (either the file
or the XPath query) could not be found at the time the assembly was compiled.
The default is False to ignore <codeInline>include</codeInline> tags.</para>

<alert class="note">
  <para>If you are writing C# code, invalid <codeInline>include</codeInline>
comment tags are easy to find at the time the assembly is built as the
compiler issues a warning (CS1589 or CS1592).  The VB.NET compiler does not
output a warning, nor does it write the invalid tag to the comments file.  As
such, this option will have no effect in VB.NET generated XML comments files.
The same is true for managed C++ generated XML comments files except the
compiler does generate a warning (C4637).</para>

  <para>By now you're probably wondering "So, what was the point of adding
this property?" Well, somebody requested it and I didn't find out it was only
useful with C# XML comments files until after I'd done the work and by then I
couldn't be bothered to go back and take out all the code and resource items.
So, it's there but off by default.</para>

<section address="MissingNS">
  <title>ShowMissingNamespaces</title>
  <content><para>This property lets you indicate whether or not a red "missing"
message is inserted into each namespace topic that is missing its namespace
comments.  The default is True to add the message.  Namespace comments can be
added using the <codeInline>NamespaceSummaries</codeInline> project property,
by using an external XML comments file, or by using a <codeInline>NamespaceDoc</codeInline>
class in your code.  See the <link xlink:href="eb7e1bc7-21c5-4453-bbaf-dec8c62c15bd" />
for details.</para>

<section address="MissingParams">
  <title>ShowMissingParams</title>
  <content><para>This property lets you indicate whether or not a red "missing"
message is inserted into the help topic for each method parameter that is
missing its related <codeInline>&lt;param&gt;</codeInline> tag documentation.
The default is True to add the message.</para>

  <title>ShowMissingRemarks</title>
  <content><para>This property lets you indicate whether or not a red "missing"
message is inserted into the help topic if the <codeInline>&lt;remarks&gt;</codeInline>
tag has not been specified for the item.  The default is False to ignore items
with missing or empty <codeInline>&lt;remarks&gt;</codeInline> tags.</para>

  <content><para>This property lets you indicate whether or not a red "missing"

item.  The default is True to add the message.</para>
