			<para>This property page allows you to define scripts that run before and/or after the build.  The extended
editor dialog box that is resizable and contains a list of the common macros can be accessed by clicking the
button following each property editor text box.</para>

				<para>By specifying a custom build event, you can automatically run commands before a build starts or
after it finishes. For example, you can run a <localUri>.bat</localUri> file before a build starts or copy the
build output to a folder after the build is completed.  Build events run only if the build successfully reaches
those points in the build process.  The scripts consist of the same commands that you would use at the command
prompt.  Macros can be used to substitute common values from the project such as the project path, the project
name, the current configuration, etc.</para>

				<para>The following are some general tips on creating pre-build and post-build event scripts:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Place each command on a separate line.  Separate each with a line break.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Add a <codeInline>call</codeInline> statement before all build events that run
<localUri>.bat</localUri> files.  For example: <codeInline>call C:\Project\CopyMyFiles.bat</codeInline>.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>If you specify files or macros that can contain path or file names, enclose them in quotes
so that the commands handle paths and filenames containing spaces correctly.  For example:
<codeInline>COPY "$(ProjectDir)Help\*.*" "C:\Project\Build Output\"</codeInline></para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>In the extended editor dialog box, select a macro from the grid below the text box and click
the <ui>Insert</ui> button to insert it at the current cursor location.  An example of the macro's value
based on the current project settings is shown to the right of its name.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The pre-build event will run unconditionally.  The post-build event can be set to run only if
the build succeeds or to run always by changing the value in the combo box following the post-build event text
box on the property page.</para>
