		<introduction>
			<para>The <application>BuildAssembler</application> tool contains a transformation build component that
takes the reflection data, XML comments, and/or MAML topics and converts them to a format suitable for use in
the resulting help file.  The XSL transformations that it uses to accomplish this vary by presentation style and
may expose arguments that can be used to customize the transformation.  For example, the existing XSL
transformations for the standard Sandcastle presentation styles expose a set of arguments used to insert a logo
image into the page headers.  Such arguments are exposed to your project using this property page.</para>

				<para>The list of available transform component arguments is shown on the left.  As you select each one,
information about it and its current value are displayed on the right.  The description at the top of the page
provides information about the argument's purpose, how to use it, and information about valid values that it
supports.  The two checkboxes indicate whether the argument is used for conceptual and/or reference builds.</para>

				<para>For simple values, a single-line text box is provided in which you can enter the value to use for
the argument.  If the argument supports a more complex value such as an XML fragment, a multi-line text box will
appear instead.</para>
