  <title>Project Summary</title>
  <content>
		<para>The <codeInline>Project Summary</codeInline> property allows you to enter summary comments that should
appear in the root namespaces page of the compiled help file.  This is the standard default page unless
additional or conceptual content is defined that is marked as the default page.  Depending on the presentation
style, the Namespaces page is also accessible via the breadcrumb link available at the top of the namespace item
help pages in the generated help file.  These comments will appear above the list of namespaces and can contain
HTML markup (i.e. text formatting, e-mail links, etc.).  The comments can also include the
<codeInline>&lt;inheritdoc /&gt;</codeInline> tag so that you can import the description or parts of a
description from another namespace, type, or member.  If no project summary is defined, the page just shows the
list of namespaces.</para>

  <title>Namespace Summaries</title>
  <content>
		<para>Clicking the <ui>Edit Namespace Summaries</ui> button allows you to specify which namespaces should
appear in the help file as well as the namespace summaries to display in the root namespaces page and on the help
page for each namespace.</para>

		<para>When the form is opened, it scans the documentation assemblies for new namespaces and adds them to the
list if it finds any.  As you select each namespace, the list of assemblies in which it appears is shown to the
right and its current description appears in the text box below the lists.  Namespaces can be filtered by
assembly and/or by entering some text or a regular expression to match and clicking the <ui>Apply</ui> button.
Setting the assembly combo box back to "&lt;All&gt;", clearing the search text, and clicking <ui>Apply</ui> will
redisplay all assemblies.</para>

		<para>To edit a namespace summary, select the namespace in the list and edit the comments in the text box at
the bottom of the form.  The comments can include HTML markup (i.e. bolding, e-mail links, etc).  If no summary
is defined, a red warning note will appear for the namespace on the root namespaces page and above the namespace
content in the help page for the namespace itself.  If you build a help file without updating the namespace list,
any unknown namespaces will appear in the help file but they will also contain a red warning message indicating
that the namespace summary is missing.  The warning can be removed by setting the
<codeInline>Show Missing Namespaces</codeInline> project option to false.  Namespace summaries also support the
<codeInline>&lt;inheritdoc /&gt;</codeInline> tag so that you can import the description or parts of a
description from another namespace, type, or member.</para>

		<para>Namespaces are never removed from the list even if the namespace no longer appears in one of the
documented assemblies.  You can remove old namespaces from the list by selecting them and clicking the
<ui>Delete</ui> button.  The "<codeInline>(global)</codeInline>" namespace is a special case and, although it can
be deleted, it will be added automatically to remove unwanted information that appears in the global namespace.</para>

		<para>You may check the namespaces that you want to appear and uncheck those that you do not want to appear.
By default, all namespaces in all assemblies are documented with the exception of the global (unnamed) namespace
that sometimes appears and contains private module details.  This information is automatically merged with the
project's <codeInline>Api Filter</codeInline> settings at build time.  To avoid conflicts, you may want to leave
all of your namespaces checked here and use the <link xlink:href="7df16a60-f718-4b8f-bfa2-88c42906070c" />
exclusively to manage the namespaces excluded from the documentation.</para>
