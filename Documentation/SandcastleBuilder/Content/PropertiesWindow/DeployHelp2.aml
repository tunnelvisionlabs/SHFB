    <introduction>
      <para>The MS Help 2 system maintains a registry of all help collections
and titles currently installed on a machine.  This registry determines what
help titles are included in each help collection as well as maintaining
references between the help collections.</para>
    </introduction>

<section>
  <content><para>Unlike HTML Help 1 (CHM) files, an MS Help 2 title or
collection must be registered in order to view it. This makes deploying HTML
Help 2 documentation more complex than simply delivering a single file and
creating a shortcut to it.  While it is possible to create a Windows Installer
package to deploy and register help collections and titles, it is a rather
lengthy process and it does not always work as well as it should.</para>

<para>The easiest approach to deploying and registering Help 2 collections is
to use the shareware tool <externalLink>
  <linkText>H2Reg.exe</linkText>
  <linkUri>http://www.helpware.net/mshelp2/h2reg.htm</linkUri>
  <linkTarget>_blank</linkTarget>
</externalLink> from <externalLink>
  <linkText>The Helpware Group</linkText>
  <linkUri>http://www.helpware.net</linkUri>
  <linkTarget>_blank</linkTarget>
</externalLink>.  It is a command line tool that can be included by scripted
installers as well as Windows Installer packages as a custom action.</para>

<para>When producing an MS Help 2 file, the help file builder produces a
valid set of collection files and creates a configuration file suitable for
use by <localUri>H2Reg.exe</localUri>.  In order to deploy the generated HTML
Help 2 files, follow these steps:</para>

<list class="ordered">
    <listItem>Set the <codeInline>PlugInNamespaces</codeInline> project
property to a comma separated list of one or more namespaces that your
collection should be plugged into when deployed.  The default setting will plug
it into all available collections.  See the <localUri>H2Reg.exe</localUri> help
file for details about the possible values that can be used.</listItem>

    <listItem>Build the help project.</listItem>
    
    <listItem>Include all of the generated help files as well as the generated
configuration file and the <localUri>H2Reg.exe</localUri> executable in your
installer.</listItem>

    <listItem>During installation, copy the help files, the configuration file,
and <localUri>H2Reg.exe</localUri> to their installed location.</listItem>

    <listItem>Execute <localUri>H2Reg.exe</localUri> with the following syntax:

<code lang="none">
H2Reg -r "CmdFile=&lt;Path to the configuration file&gt;"
</code>
	</listItem>

    <listItem>During uninstallation, before the help files are removed, execute
<localUri>H2Reg.exe</localUri> with the following syntax:

<code lang="none">
H2Reg -u "CmdFile=&lt;Path to the configuration file&gt;"
</code>
	</listItem>

</list>

<para>Your product's installer can create a shortcut to open your Help 2 file
by executing the following command (lines wrapped for display purposes):</para>

<code lang="none" title=" ">
"%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\Help\dexplore.exe"
  /helpcol ms-help://MyProduct.Namespace
</code>

<para>Substitute your product's namespace for
<codeInline>MyProduct.Namespace</codeInline> in the example above.</para>
