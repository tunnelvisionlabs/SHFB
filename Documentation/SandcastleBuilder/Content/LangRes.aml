		<introduction>
			<para>Sandcastle uses a set of resource files to contain text such as table of contents item titles, common
topic element titles, messages, etc.  Copies of the resource files are located in a <localUri>.\Content</localUri>
subfolder beneath each presentation style folder.  The presentation style folders are located in the
<localUri>.\Presentation</localUri> folder in the main Sandcastle installation folder.</para>
		</introduction>

		<section>
			<title>The Resource Files</title>
			<content>
				<para>The following files contain the resources:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para><localUri>conceptual_content.xml</localUri> contains titles for items in conceptual content
files.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><localUri>feedBack_content.xml</localUri> contains items related to the feedback control in the
VS2005 presentation style.  Currently, the feedback control is not used by any of the presentation styles.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><localUri>reference_content.xml</localUri> contains titles for the various class library parts,
filter text, and alternate image text.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><localUri>shared_content.xml</localUri> contains paths to the shared content (art, scripts, and
style sheets), code section labels, and customizable text for the header and footer in each page.  The help file
builder overrides many of these using its own content file.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><localUri>syntax_content.xml</localUri> contains some programming language limitation messages.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><localUri>token_content.xml</localUri> contains some supplemental reference messages.</para>
					</listItem>

				</list>

				<para>The supplied files are all in English but can be translated into other languages for use in your
help files.  The help file builder includes its own shared content files which are used to override elements in
the above files for such things as the help title, header and footer text, preliminary documentation message,
etc. There are several copies of the shared content files, each representing a different language.  You can find
the files in the <localUri>.\SharedContent</localUri> folder under the Sandcastle Help File Builder installation
folder.  The files all start with <legacyBold>SharedBuilderContent_</legacyBold> or
<legacyBold>XXXBuilderContent_</legacyBold> where "XXX" is a presentation style name and all are suffixed with a
language ID based on the value returned by the <codeInline>CultureInfo.Name</codeInline> property (i.e. en-US,
fr-FR, de-DE).  Each file has a "<localUri>.xml</localUri>" extension.</para>

				<para>A set of stop word list files also exists in the help file builder's shared content folder that are
used when creating the full text index for the website build and for the MS Help 2 file.  The files contain a
list of common words that are excluded from the full-text index.  This prevents the index files from getting too
large and containing useless information.  You can add additional words to these files as needed.  The files all
start with <legacyBold>StopWordList_</legacyBold> and are suffixed with a language ID based on the value returned
by the <codeInline>CultureInfo.Name</codeInline> property (i.e. en-US, fr-FR, de-DE).  Each file has a
<localUri>.txt</localUri> extension.</para>

			<title>Localizing Language Resources</title>
			<content>
				<para>To create a help file builder resource file for a new language, copy one of the existing files and
change the name to use the culture name's ID as described above.  If you are not sure what ID to use in the
filename, go to the <externalLink><linkText>Locale Identifier Constants and Strings</linkText>
<linkUri>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318693.aspx</linkUri><linkTarget>_blank</linkTarget>
</externalLink> MSDN topic and locate the locale that you need.  The primary language and sublanguage columns
contain the ID values in parentheses.  Combine the two values in parentheses from those columns separated by an
underscore for the ID to use in the filename.  Edit the new file and translate the text to the selected language.
If people are kind enough to supply additional translated files, they will be added to later releases.</para>

				<para>Due to the number of presentation styles and the number of files that would be created, it is not
possible to provide a matching set of Sandcastle's content files for each language.  You will need to create
localized copies of them for each language that you want.  As above, if people are kind enough to supply
additional translated files, they will be added to later releases.  The standard files in the noted
<localUri>.\Content</localUri> folders will always be used when English (en-US) is used as the selected language
or if files for the selected language cannot be found.  Note that these files tend to change with each new
release of Sandcastle so you may have to compare and merge changes with your localized versions after each new
release is issued.</para>

				<para>To create your own localized versions of the content files, create a folder below each of the
noted <localUri>.\Content</localUri> folders. The new folder should be named after the selected language ID
(i.e. fr-FR, de-DE, etc.).  Copy the Sandcastle content files to the new language folder and translate their
content.  When translating <localUri>shared_content.xml</localUri>, be sure to set the value of the item with the
<legacyBold>locale</legacyBold> ID to the correct language ID.  When you do a build with a language other than
English, the help file builder will automatically look for a folder named after the selected language and will
use the translated files if it finds them.  If the translated files cannot be found, a warning is issued in the
log file and the English versions will be used.</para>

				<para>How the files are encoded is very important if they contain extended characters.  To ensure that
the help file builder and the Sandcastle tools properly interpret the encoding within the files, it is best to
save the files such that they contain byte order marks at the start of the file for Unicode encoded formats as
well as an XML header tag that specifies the correct encoding. In the absence of byte order marks, the encoding
in the XML header tag ensures that the file is still interpreted correctly.  The supplied default language
resource files contain examples of this.</para>

				<para>When using entities to represent special characters in the XML language resource files or in the
header text, copyright text, etc, use the numeric form rather than the name form as the XML parser will not
recognize them and will throw an exception.  For example, if you specify <codeInline>&amp;Auml;</codeInline>
(Latin capital letter A with diaeresis) an exception will be generated.  To fix it, use the numeric form instead
(<codeInline>&amp;#196;</codeInline>).  This also applies to symbols such as <codeInline>&amp;copy;</codeInline>
in the copyright text. Instead, you should use <codeInline>&amp;#169;</codeInline> to get the copyright symbol.</para>
