		<introduction>
			<para>The help file builder has the ability to utilize third-party custom build components, plug-ins, and
presentation styles.  In addition, the project system allows you to add files based on user-defined template
files.  Build components and plug-ins can also create configuration or cache files to use across builds if
needed.  In order to work correctly, each type of file must be located in the correct place.</para>

				<para>None of the folders mentioned below exist by default so you will need to create them yourself.
The exception is the root local application data folder.  It will be created on first use by the help file
builder if referenced by a build component or a plug-in configuration.</para>

				<para>There are two root application data folders (<legacyBold>Common Application Data</legacyBold> and
<legacyBold>Local Application Data</legacyBold>).  These equate to one of the following folders based on your
operating system:</para>

				<para>Third-party build components that you want to use from within the help file builder via the
<codeInline>ComponentConfigurations</codeInline> project property and custom syntax filter generators accessible
via the <codeInline>SyntaxFilters</codeInline> project property must be placed in the <legacyBold>Common
Application Data</legacyBold> folder.  This equates to one of the following folders based on your operating
system:</para>

				<para>Put the build components and any of their required configuration and supporting files within the
noted folder or a subfolder beneath it.  These will be shared by all users on the same computer.  All component
configuration filenames must have <localUri>.components</localUri> as their extension.  All syntax filter
generator definition files must have <localUri>.filters</localUri> as their extension.</para>

				<para>Third-party build process plug-ins that you want to use from within the help file builder via the
<codeInline>PlugInConfigurations</codeInline> project property must be placed in the <legacyBold>Common

				<para>Third-party presentation styles that you want to use from within the help file builder via the
<codeInline>PresentationStyle</codeInline> project property must be placed in the <legacyBold>Common Application

		<section address="BuildSettings">
			<title>User Configuration Settings and Cache Files</title>
			<content>
				<para>Due to various folder/file permission issues and in order to allow multiple users on the same
computer to have their own custom settings and cache files used by build components and plug-ins, these types of
files must be stored in the <legacyBold>Local Application Data</legacyBold> folder (see the
<link xlink:href="#RootFolders">Root Application Data Folders</link> section above).</para>

				<para>As an example, the cached build components supplied with the help file builder create their cache
files in the following location based on the operating system:</para>

				</table>

				<para>Each user is free to delete such files to get back to a default state without affecting other users
on the same computer.  Likewise, they can give copies of their settings files to other users for them to place in
a like named folder in their settings area to make use of them as well.</para>

		<section address="FileTemplates">

				<para>Due to various folder/file permission issues and in order to allow multiple users on the same
computer to have their own custom file templates, these types of files must be stored in the <legacyBold>Local
Application Data</legacyBold> folder.  This equates to one of the following folders based on your operating
system:</para>

				<para>Use the <localUri>Item Templates</localUri> folder to store custom templates for project files such
as images, HTML files, stylesheets, script files, tokens, code snippets, or XML files.  Use the
<localUri>Conceptual Templates</localUri> folder to store custom MAML topic template files.  These template files
appear on the <ui>Custom Templates</ui> submenus within the project explorer, site map editor, and content layout
file editor.</para>

				<para>Each user is free to delete such files to get back to a default state without affecting other users
on the same computer.  Likewise, they can give copies of their template files to other users for them to place in
the templates folder in their settings area to make use of them as well.</para>

					<para>This only applies to the standalone GUI.  To define custom file templates for the Visual Studio
package, see the <link xlink:href="ece3a395-589f-45c3-9f0e-2a25b8b6c537" /> topic.</para>

		<section address="XCopyDeployment">
			<title>XCOPY/Build Server Deployment</title>
			<content>
				<para>For use in a build server environment the Sandcastle Help File Builder also supports simple XCOPY
deployment.  As long as the <environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable> environment variable points to
the location of the help file builder assemblies, it will be able to find everything it needs at build time.  In
such situations, custom build components and plug-ins may also be copied to the help file builder folder or a
sub-folder beneath it.  When searching for custom build components and plug-ins the following search order is
used:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>If a <environmentVariable>SHFBCOMPONENTROOT</environmentVariable> environment variable is
defined (optional), it is searched first.</para>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>
						<para>Next, the help file builder installation folder (<environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable>)
is searched.</para>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>
						<para>Finally, the common application data folders noted above are searched.</para>
					</listItem>
				</list>

				<para>If any duplicate components or plug-ins are encountered, the first one loaded based on the above
search order will be used.  Custom presentation styles can also be located in the help file builder installation
folder.</para>
