		<introduction>
			<para>For use in a build server environment, the Sandcastle Help File Builder and Tools also support simple
XCOPY deployment.  As long as the <environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable> system environment variable
points to the location of the help file builder assemblies, it will be able to find everything it needs at build
time.  In such situations, custom build components, plug-ins, syntax generators, and presentation styles may also
be copied to the help file builder folder or a sub-folder beneath it.</para>

				<para>When searching for custom components, the following search order is used:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>If a <codeInline>ComponentPath</codeInline> project property value is set, the folder it refers
to is searched first and then the actual project folder is searched.  If the property contains no value, the
actual project folder is searched first.</para>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>
						<para>Next, the common application data folders noted in the
<link xlink:href="a24489fb-45d6-46f4-9eaa-9a9c4e0919b2" /> topic are searched.</para>
					</listItem>
					<listItem>
						<para>Finally, the help file builder installation folder (<environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable>)
is searched.</para>
					</listItem>
				</list>

				<para>If any duplicate components are encountered, the first one loaded based on the above search order
will be used.</para>

				<para>It is possible to build a project without defining the <codeInline>SHFBROOT</codeInline>
environment variable.  To do this, a conditional <codeInline>SHFBROOT</codeInline> property must be added to each
help file builder project as a child of the main <codeInline>PropertyGroup</codeInline> element.  An example is
shown below:</para>

<code language="xml" title=" ">
&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
	&lt;SHFBROOT Condition=" '$(SHFBROOT)' == '' "&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\..\Relative
		Path\ToSHFB\Adjust As Needed&lt;/SHFBROOT&gt;
	
	... other SHFB project properties ...

&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code>

				<para>By making it conditional, you can work with the project on your local machine with the available
tools where the environment variable is defined but still allow it to be built on a server using a simple XCOPY
deployment.</para>
