				<para>From its very beginning, the help file builder was written to be a viable replacement for NDoc.  As
such, almost all of the NDoc project properties have matching help file builder project properties and convert
straight across to the equivalent properties in the new project.  However, after conversion, the following items
will need to be reviewed:</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Review the <legacyBold>Documentation Sources</legacyBold> and <legacyBold>References</legacyBold>
project nodes to see that the required items were imported correctly and make any necessary adjustments.</para>

						<token>SolutionDocSource</token>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>All files and subfolders in the folder specified in the NDoc
<codeInline>AdditionalContentResourceDirectory</codeInline> property are added recursively to the project as file
items.  In addition, the files in the <codeInline>FilesToInclude</codeInline> property and the various Help 2
<codeInline>NamedUrlIndex</codeInline> page type related properties are also added to the project as file items.
Each file will have a default build action based on its file extension.  You can add a site map to the project
and edit it to set the order and layout of the additional content HTML files.</para>

						<alert class="tip">
							<para>The help file builder contains full support for conceptual content that uses Microsoft
Assistance Markup Language (MAML) to create additional non-API topics such as How-Tos, walkthroughs, etc.  You
may want to consider switching any additional HTML content to conceptual content to take advantage of its
features.  See the <link xlink:href="3d4edd2d-7883-4508-b9d2-bd7b4d848b0d" /> topic for more information.</para>
						</alert>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>NDoc project files contain sections for several different documenters that it supported.  Since
there is no indication as to which is the active documenter, all properties are imported from the
<codeInline>MSDN</codeInline>, <codeInline>MSDN-CHM</codeInline>, <codeInline>VS.NET 2003</codeInline>, and
<codeInline>MSDN 2003</codeInline> documenters.  If the documenters contain properties that are duplicated in the
other documenters, it is possible that the wrong value may end up in the converted project.  Review the
properties after conversion to be sure that the values that you wanted were used.</para>
