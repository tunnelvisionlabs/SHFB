    <introduction>
      <para>The IntelliSense Component is used to extract the XML comments into
files that can be used for IntelliSense.  Only the basic set of tags needed for
IntelliSense are exported and only for documented API members.  This can
significantly reduce the size of the XML comments files used for IntelliSense
and will remove any details about undocumented API members such as private and
internal members unless they are included in the build.  When used in
conjunction with the <legacyBold>Show Missing Documentation Component</legacyBold>,
this component can be used to produce XML comments files for assemblies that do
not currently have one so that you can fill in comments for them.</para>
    </introduction>

<section>
  <content><para>The following is the default configuration for the IntelliSense
component. It should be inserted into the configuration file before the
<codeInline>TransformComponent</codeInline>.  If you are using the Show Missing
Documentation component, you should insert it after that one so that you can
get information about missing documentation items as well.</para>

<code lang="xml" title="Example Configuration">
&lt;!-- IntelliSense component configuration.  This must appear
     before the TransformComponent. --&gt;
&lt;component type="SandcastleBuilder.Components.IntelliSenseComponent"
  assembly="{@SHFBFolder}SandcastleBuilder.Components.dll"&gt;
 &lt;!-- Output options (optional)
      Attributes:
         Include Namespaces (false by default)
         Namespaces filename ("Namespaces" if not specified or empty)
         Directory (current folder if not specified or empty) --&gt;
 &lt;output includeNamespaces="false" namespacesFile="Namespaces"
     folder="{@OutputFolder}" /&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</code>

	<para>The example given above is taken from the Sandcastle Help File
Builder's configuration file.  When used with it, the replacement tags
<codeInline>{@SHFBFolder}</codeInline> and <codeInline>{@OutputFolder}</codeInline>
are used to insert the help file builder's folder and the project's output
folder in the file paths.  These are replaced at build time with the
appropriate values.  If using the component in your own build scripts, replace
the tags with a relative or absolute path to the component assembly and output
folder respectively.</para>

	<para>The <codeInline>folder</codeInline> attribute identifies the folder in
which to place the IntelliSense files.  One file is created for each assembly.
If set to true, the <codeInline>includeNamespaces</codeInline> option will
cause the build component to output project summary and namespace summary
comments to a file identified by the <codeInline>namespacesFile</codeInline>
attribute in the given output folder.  If specified, you should enter only the
name and omit any file path and extension.  The namespaces file is not used for
IntelliSense but can be added to one or more help file builder projects as a
common documentation source to share project and namespace summary information
betwen projects.</para>
