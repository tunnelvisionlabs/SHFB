			<para>Documentation sources are how you specify the assemblies, XML comments files, and/or solutions and
projects that define the reference (API) content of the help file.</para>

			<title>Adding a Documentation Source</title>
			<content>
				<para>To add a documentation source, right click on the <ui>Documentation Sources</ui> project node and
select <ui>Add Documentation Source...</ui> or select <ui>File | Project Explorer | Documentation Sources |
Add Documentation Source...</ui>.  An Open File dialog box appears in which you can select one or more DLLs,
executables, XML comments files, or Visual Studio solutions/projects associated with the items to document.
When adding a DLL or an executable, if an XML comments file with the same name is found, it is also added to the
project automatically.  Likewise, if you select an XML comments file, a DLL or executable with a matching name is
added to the project automatically if it exists.  Files can also be dragged and dropped on the node from Windows
Explorer.</para>

				<para>If a solution file is selected, a dialog box will appear asking whether you want to add the
solution as the documentation source or selected projects within it.  If the solution file is added, all projects
within it will be included when the help file is built including projects added to it at a later date.  If you
select specific projects from it, only those projects will be added as documentation sources.</para>

				<alert class="note">
					<para>If you do not add an associated XML comments file for an assembly, no comments will appear on the
documented members in the help file topics that are built.</para>

					<para>Only add assemblies and projects that you want documented to this project node.  Third-party
assemblies, interop assemblies, and other dependent DLLs should be added to the project's

			<title>Editing a Documentation Source</title>
			<content>
				<para>When selected, each documentation source has the following properties that can be edited in the
property grid at the bottom of the Project Explorer window.  Some of the properties will only apply to certain
types of documentation source as indicated.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para><codeInline>SourceFile</codeInline> - This can be an individual file or it can contain
wildcards (* or ?) to include multiple files.  If the extension is a wildcard (i.e *.* or ProjectName.*), it will
include any assembly, XML comments file, solution or project that matches the wildcard.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><codeInline>IncludeSubFolders</codeInline> - If the <codeInline>SourceFile</codeInline>
property contains a wildcard, this property will be used to determine whether all matching files are included
from subfolders as well (True) or if just the files in the indicated folder are included (False).</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><codeInline>Configuration</codeInline> - For Visual Studio solution and project documentation
sources, this can be used to indicate that a specific configuration value should be used when extracting assembly,
comments file, and reference information.  If not set, the global <codeInline>Configuration</codeInline> option
setting is used.  The default global option value is <codeInline>Debug</codeInline>.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><codeInline>Platform</codeInline> - For Visual Studio solution and project documentation
sources, this can be used to indicate that a specific platform value should be used when extracting assembly,
comments file, and reference information.  If not set, the global <codeInline>Platform</codeInline> option
setting is used.  The default global option value is <codeInline>AnyCPU</codeInline>.</para>
