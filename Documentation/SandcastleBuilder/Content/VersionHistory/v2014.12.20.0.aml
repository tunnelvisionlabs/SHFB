				<para>If you have custom presentation styles or use the ESent or SQL Server cached data components, the
following breaking changes will affect them.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the BuildAssembler configuration files to use framework-specific folders for the
reflection data.  This will prevent all of the "unknown reference link" warnings caused by members of the
different frameworks not present in the old reflection data which was only for the core .NET Framework.  It also
allows for only the framework-specific base class members to be included on the member list pages.</para>

						<para>If you have custom presentation styles, you will need to update your BuildAssembler
configuration files by replacing the <localUri>Data\Reflection</localUri> path with the substitution tag as
follows: <localUri>Data\{@TargetFrameworkIdentifier}</localUri>.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the ESent and SQL data cache build components to use the new framework-specific folder
locations for reference link target data.  If you use any of these components, you must delete them from the
project, add them back, and configure them in order for the updated configuration to take effect.</para>

			<title>Other Changes Made in This Release</title>
			<content>
				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed a bug in the MPF code that caused renaming files using the Solution Explorer to add a new
file under the new name and keep the old file thus causing source control to get confused and think there was a
duplicate file.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Encoded component paths written to the BuildAssembler configuration files to allow for paths
containing XML entities such as the ampersand.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed <codeInline>ComponentUtilities.ToolsFolder</codeInline> so that it always prefers the
executing assembly location over <environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable> unless running under Visual
Studio.  This allows for a local project version of the help file builder tools to correctly take precedence over
the installed version.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed a couple of incorrect syntax generator IDs that caused the F# namespaces to not be
included for the build component namespace filter and the <localUri>AddXamlSyntaxData.xsl</localUri> transform to
be omitted when transforming the reflection data when the XAML Usage syntax generator was included.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added code to ignore <codeInline>TypeLoadException</codeInline> when searching for MEF
component assemblies. That should prevent it from failing if an assembly for an different framework version is
found during the search.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added informational tool tips and Go To Definition support for various MAML and XML comments
elements to help with navigation while editing XML comments and MAML topics in Visual Studio.  Thanks to Noah
Richards for his Go To Definition example package on which the core of the keyboard and mouse processor handlers
is based.  See the <link xlink:href="ba11d6d5-2f99-4b26-b384-21324ef1b49a" /> topic for details and information
on limitations.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added options to the Sandcastle Help File Builder options page in Visual Studio to allow
enabling and disabling of the extended XML comments completion and Go To Definition features.  This allows you to
turn them off if you do not want to use them or if you think they may be causing problems.</para>
