  <title>Breaking Changes</title>
  <content>
<list class="bullet">
    <listItem>All projects and components are now built using the .NET
Framework 3.5 SP1.  As such, you must have the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
installed to use the help file builder and components.  It can still build
help files for any framework version from .NET 1.1 to .NET 3.5.</listItem>

    <listItem>When a custom build component was added to the project in prior
releases, attributes from the <codeInline>component</codeInline> node other
than the ID, type, and assembly were not included in the project's copy of the
configuration.  This problem has been corrected.  The only component affected
by this fix is the <legacyBold>Cached MSDN URL References</legacyBold>
component.  If you use it in your projects, you should delete it and re-add it
in the <codeInline>ComponentConfigurations</codeInline> project property so
that it picks up the locale and link target attributes in order to use the
appropriate settings for them during a build.</listItem>

    <listItem>The IDs on the <codeInline>HierarchicalTocPlugIn</codeInline> and
the <codeInline>TocExcludePlugIn</codeInline> changed.  You will need to delete
them from the <codeInline>PlugInConfigurations</codeInline> project property
and add them back in to pick up the new IDs.</listItem>

    <listItem>The location of user-defined template files and build component
cache files has changed.  They are now stored in the
<localUri>Local Application Data</localUri> folder rather than the
<localUri>Common Application Data</localUri> folder.  However, the custom
build components and plug-ins will themselves still reside in the
<localUri>Common Application Data</localUri> folder.  You should remove and
add the three cached build components to the project file so that they use the
new location.  Any existing cache files can be moved to the new local data
folder.  This change was made to avoid problems with security and clashes with
modified template and cache files when multiple people use the same PC.  See
the <link xlink:href="a24489fb-45d6-46f4-9eaa-9a9c4e0919b2" /> topic for more
information.</listItem>

  <title>Other Changes in This Release</title>
  <content>

<list class="bullet">
    <listItem>Relative hint paths on reference items are now converted to full
paths at build time so that they are located correctly.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added <codeInline>ExtensionAttribute</codeInline> to the
<application>MRefBuilder </application> attribute filter and excluded it from
the <codeInline>DocumentAttributes</codeInline> property processing so that
extension methods are documented correctly.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug in the Help 1 build project template that caused it
to use the table of contents definition file for the index.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug that caused the Output Deployment plug-in to fail if
a folder did not already exist when deploying to a file path.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added " " (space), "*", and "?" to the characters replaced with
an underscore by the <codeInline>MemberName</codeInline> naming method code to
prevent save failures when the help topics are saved.</listItem>

    <listItem>Paths to the comments files in <localUri>sandcastle.config</localUri>
are now expanded fully before being written to it to prevent issues with
environment variables expanding differently when the build engine runs as a
32-bit MSBuild process but the build step project runs as a 64-bit MSBuild
process.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added code to turn off the read-only attribute on MAML topics
when they are copied to the working folder.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added code to the <legacyBold>Post-Transform Component</legacyBold>
so that <codeInline>see</codeInline> tags within code blocks are converted to
links when the Code Block Component's <codeInline>keepSeeTags</codeInline>
option is used.  A prior release broke it due to changes needed to get the
components to colorize code in conceptual builds.  Note that the referenced
target names must be fully qualified in order to get resolved.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug in the <legacyBold>Show Missing Documentation</legacyBold>
component that caused it to fail if an auto-documented constructor's signature
contained unencoded special XML characters.</listItem>

    <listItem>If the <codeInline>DocumentSealedProtected</codeInline> property
is set to False, it now removes inherited protected members too.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>ShowMissingIncludeTargets</codeInline>
project property.  This is used to add a "missing" message if an
<codeInline>&lt;include&gt;</codeInline> tag is found in the comments for a
topic indicating a missing file or invalid XPath query.  However, it's really
only useful for C# generated XML comments files
<link xlink:href="5a2ab898-7161-454d-b5d3-959df0de0e36#MissingIncTargets">(don't ask)</link>.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>UserDefinedProperties</codeInline> project
property to the <legacyBold>Build</legacyBold> category.  This allows you to
add or edit user-defined MSBuild project properties that can be used to hold
additional information or for use in substitution tags within other help file
builder project properties.</listItem>

	<listItem>Added support for <codeInline>CustomBeforeSHFBTargets</codeInline>
and <codeInline>CustomAfterSHFBTargets</codeInline> properties that can define
custom projects containing property or target overrides imported and
evaluated before and after the help file builder targets respectively.  These
can be defined on the command line to import the custom targets and property
overrides.</listItem>

    <listItem>Substitution tag replacement (i.e. <codeInline>{@PropName}</codeInline>)
now includes support for using any property name defined in the project.  This
includes user-defined MSBuild properties not recognized as help file builder
properties and all global properties defined in the MSBuild build
engine (reserved properties, environment variables, etc.).</listItem>

    <listItem>The <codeInline>HelpFileVersion</codeInline> project property is
now a string value.  This allows you to specify user-defined MSBuild project
properties to define the value (i.e. <codeInline>{@Version}</codeInline> or
<codeInline>{@Major}.{@Minor}.{@Build}.{@Revision}</codeInline>).  The end
result must still evaluate to a valid four-part version number.  If not, a
build error will occur (<link
xlink:href="e4c00c10-9368-4790-b1c4-4a47adeb2af9">BE0066</link>).</listItem>

    <listItem>Added an optional execution priority value to the
<codeInline>ExecutionPoint</codeInline> object so that plug-ins can set
an execution priority for each build step.  It is used to determine the order
in which the plug-ins will be executed.  Those with a higher priority value
will be executed before those with a lower value.  Those with an identical
priority may be executed in any order within their group.  If not explicitly
defined, the default priority value is 1000.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>SandcastleBuilder.MRefBuilder</codeInline>
assembly which contains the <codeInline>BindingRedirectResolver</codeInline>
component used by the <legacyBold>Assembly Binding Redirection</legacyBold>
plug-in.  The resolver component can be used in other third-party tools and
standalone build scripts.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <link xlink:href="2152ed96-bf69-4b9b-b1a7-4fffc71b3095">Before
Building</link> user preference that lets you specify how to handle project and
document changes prior to building the help file or previewing a topic.</listItem>

	<listItem><para>Added the following new plug-ins:</para>

Thanks to Eyal Post for donating the code upon which this plug-in is based.</listItem>

    <listItem>Thanks to Jeroen Vos for providing up to date information on
using the Sandcastle Help File Builder v1.8.0.0 or later with Visual Studio
Team Foundation Server 2008 SP1.</listItem>
