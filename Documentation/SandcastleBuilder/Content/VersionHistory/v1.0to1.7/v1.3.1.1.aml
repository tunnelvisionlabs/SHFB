    <listItem>Support for the October 7th Sandcastle CTP Refresh was confirmed.
A patch file for some of the Sandcastle style and transformation files is
supplied separately to fix a few issues that still remain with the stock
versions supplied with Sandcastle.  Extract the patch to your Sandcastle
installation folder.  See the ReadMe.txt file included with it for details
on the fixes that I made.</listItem>

    <listItem>The UTF-8 encoding is now preserved on XML comments files when
adding the missing documentation tags.  They lack an encoding attribute and
byte order marks but are UTF-8 encoded and are now always treated as such
to preserve the encodings on extended characters in the authored comments.</listItem>

    <listItem>If <codeInline>DocumentAttributes</codeInline> is set to false, the
<codeInline>[Serializable]</codeInline> attributes are removed from the syntax section
now as well.</listItem>

    <listItem>Implemented several new <codeInline>Document*</codeInline> properties that
behave like the matching NDoc properties.  See the <legacyBold>Visibility Category
Properties</legacyBold> topic in the help file for more information.</listItem>
