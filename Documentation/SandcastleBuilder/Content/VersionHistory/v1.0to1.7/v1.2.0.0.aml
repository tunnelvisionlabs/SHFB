      <para>Version 1.2.0.0 was released on September 6th, 2006.</para>

      <title>Changes in This Release</title>
      <content>
<list class="bullet">
    <listItem>A new <legacyBold>Prj Summary</legacyBold> button appears on the main form in the
Assemblies to Document section.  It opens a form in which you can enter
summary comments that should appear in the root namespaces page of the
compiled help file.</listItem>

    <listItem>A new <legacyBold>Namespaces</legacyBold> button appears on the main form that allows
you to specify which assemblies should appear in the help file and the
namespace summaries to display in the root namespaces page and on the help
page for each namespace.  By default, all namespaces in all assemblies are
documented with the exception of the global (unnamed) namespace that
sometimes appears and contains private module details.</listItem>

    <listItem>The <legacyBold>Add</legacyBold> button used to add an assembly to document now opens a
file selection dialog in which you can select one or more assemblies,
executables, or comments files to document.  It will assume that the matching
file (assembly or comments file) has the same name as the selected file.  If a
match is not found, the missing file's name is set to <legacyBold>Unknown</legacyBold> and the
<legacyBold>Edit</legacyBold> option can be used to fix it.</listItem>

    <listItem>The dependencies editor now allows the selection of a GAC item.
This allows you to specify a dependency that only resides in the GAC and
has no copy that resides elsewhere.  At build-time, the GAC is queried and
the necessary assembly is copied to the working folder for use by
MRefBuilder.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>ContentPlacement</codeInline> property that allows you to
specify whether the additional content goes in ahead of the namespaces or
after the namespaces in the table of contents.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>IsDefaultPage</codeInline> property to the
<codeInline>ContentItem</codeInline> class that allows you to indicate whether or not
the content item is the default page.  If no item is marked as the default
page, the root namespaces page is used as the default page.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug that caused the <codeInline>RootNamespaceContainer</codeInline>
property to be ignored if there was no additional content defined.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed up issues in various properties related to ampersands causing
exceptions because they cannot be interpreted by the .NET XML parser.  The
values are now HTML or URL encoded as needed.</listItem>

    <listItem>The value of the <codeInline>CopyrightText</codeInline> property is now treated
as plain text.  It will be HTML encoded where necessary to resolve issues
related to the ampersand and the .NET XML parser.  In addition, you can
encode special characters such as the copyright symbol using an escaped hex
value (i.e. &#169; = \xA9).</listItem>

    <listItem>Reworked the "run process" code so that it now reports progress as
the tools are running rather than at the end after the tool completes.
This gives more immediate feedback especially during long running builds so
that you can see that it is still alive.  It also captures the standard
error stream output so that if a tool throws an exception, that information
is now captured in the log file as well.  Where appropriate, the name of
the script being executed is also logged.</listItem>

    <listItem>Increased the font size in the log viewer dialog box to 10pt so
that it is easier to read.</listItem>

    <listItem>Path-related properties are now grouped in a new <legacyBold>Paths</legacyBold>
category in the property grid on the main form.</listItem>

    <listItem>Visual Studio 2003 projects are now loaded using the default encoding
rather than UTF-8 encoding to handle foreign language characters in the
project properties.</listItem>
