      <title>Changes in This Release</title>
      <content>
<list class="bullet">
    <listItem>Updated for use with the November 2006 CTP.  A patch file for the
Sandcastle style and transformation files is supplied separately to fix a
few issues that still remain with the stock versions supplied with
Sandcastle.  Extract the patch to your Sandcastle installation folder.  See
the ReadMe.txt file included with it for details on the fixes that I
made.</listItem>

    <listItem>Converted the Common Problems and Solutions help file topic into a
FAQ topic and added several more items to it.  A toolbar button and a
Help menu option where added to give easy access to it from the help file
builder.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the ability to add XML comments files without an associated
assembly. This is useful for adding shared project summary or namespace
summary comments to multiple projects without having to store the comments
in the Sandcastle Help File Builder project.  See the help file for
details.</listItem>

    <listItem>Paths to non-GAC dependency items can now be edited in the
Dependency Item Editor dialog box so that you can make them have relative
paths.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added an <legacyBold>MRefBuilder.config</legacyBold> template that is used to tell
MRefBuilder which framework comments to use based on the project's
<codeInline>FrameworkVersion</codeInline> property.  It is now possible to correctly
document .NET 1.0 and 1.1 assemblies.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added a new <codeInline>NamingMethod</codeInline> property that lets you
specify how the help topic filenames are created (GUID, member name, or
hashed member name). The last two make it easy to link to help topics from
external applications or web pages.  See the help file for more
information.</listItem>

    <listItem>Changed the build process to release the assembly loader
immediately after copying dependencies to prevent the lease running out and
causing an exception when trying to release it when done after a very long
build.</listItem>

    <listItem>The assembly loader was modified to add dependencies using a full
path so that it can find them correctly.</listItem>

    <listItem>Changed the <legacyBold>Index.html</legacyBold> template so that forward slashes are
used in the default topic page's path rather than backslashes.</listItem>

    <listItem>To prevent Out of Memory exceptions on extremely large builds, the
<codeInline>BuildProcess</codeInline> class now writes messages to the log file for
itself.  A Verbose Logging option was also added to the Documentation menu
in the GUI help file builder to prevent the problem as well.  If disabled,
only build step messages are logged to the output window during the build.
This is an application user setting, not a project property.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed the <codeInline>ShowMissingSummaries</codeInline> option so that if it is
set to false and <codeInline>AutoDocumentConstructors</codeInline> is set to true, it
does not add the unwanted "Missing Summary" text on methods, properties,
etc.</listItem>

    <listItem>Modified the tool searches so that if the "(x86)" version of the
Program Files folder exists (64-bit Windows), it searches in there instead
for Sandcastle and the help compilers.  If multiple copies are found in the
SDK folders, it now tries to return the latest SDK version.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed the search for Sandcastle in the PATH environment variable so
that if the help file builder path is ahead of the Sandcastle path, it
ignores it.  It will also search the VS2005 SDK folders if not found anywhere
else.</listItem>
