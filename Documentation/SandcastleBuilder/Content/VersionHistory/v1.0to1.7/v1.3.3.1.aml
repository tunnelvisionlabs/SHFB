      <title>Changes in This Release</title>
      <content>
<list class="bullet">
    <listItem><legacyBold><legacyUnderline>NOTE TO VERSION 1.3.3.0 RC USERS:</legacyUnderline></legacyBold>  You
<legacyBold><legacyUnderline>must</legacyUnderline></legacyBold> reset the <legacyBold>Post-transform Component</legacyBold> configuration
and reconfigure it before performing a build with this release due to
changes in the configuration.</listItem>

    <listItem>Updated for use with the December 2006 CTP.  A patch file for the
Sandcastle style and transformation files is supplied separately to fix
missing support for <legacyBold>br</legacyBold> and <legacyBold>hr</legacyBold> tags in the Prototype style, to
fixed numbered lists, and to add support for displaying the "Obsolete"
messages on obsolete items. Extract the patch to your Sandcastle
installation folder.  See the ReadMe.txt file included with it for details
on the fixes that I made.</listItem>
    <listItem>Implemented a code block custom build component with the following
features:
    <list class="bullet">
        <listItem>Syntax highlighting of code blocks in <codeInline>&lt;code&gt;</codeInline>
tags. Languages supported: C#, VB.NET, C++, C, JavaScript, VBScript, J#, and
XML.</listItem>

        <listItem>Excess leading whitespace is stripped from the
<codeInline>&lt;code&gt;</codeInline> blocks to left align them correctly.</listItem>

        <listItem>Support for optional line numbering.</listItem>

        <listItem>Support for optional collapsible regions for code in #region
and #if/#else/#endif blocks with support for nested collapsible regions.</listItem>

        <listItem>Support for reading in an external source file or a defined
region of an external source file so that you can keep code samples in a
buildable project to test for correctness and do away with managing the
code samples in the XML comments and include files.</listItem>
    </list></listItem>

    <listItem>Implemented a post-transform custom build component with the following
features:
    <list class="bullet">
        <listItem>Companion to the Code Block Component to add the supporting
links for the colorizer script and style sheet.</listItem>

        <listItem>It can insert a logo image at the top of each help topic.</listItem>

        <listItem>For the Prototype style, it hides the language combo box if
only one language appears in the Syntax section.</listItem>

        <listItem>Version information will be added to the help topics if used with
the help file builder.  If used outside the help file builder, a modification
is required to the Sandcastle reference content files.</listItem>
    </list></listItem>

    <listItem>Added support for the XML comments <codeInline>&lt;exclude/&gt;</codeInline>
tag.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>locale</codeInline> attribute to the
<codeInline>ResolveReferenceLinksComponent</codeInline> in <legacyBold>sandcastle.config</legacyBold> to
use the project language for the MSDN URLs.  Note that there is a small bug
in the component that causes the first reference to still point to the
English site.  This bug has been reported and will hopefully be fixed in
the next Sandcastle CTP.</listItem>

    <listItem>The build components are configured individually via the new
project option <codeInline>ComponentConfigurations</codeInline>.  Additional third
party build components can be plugged into the help file builder by adding
the default configuration to the sandcastle.config template with a unique
ID attribute and implementing a public static <codeInline>ConfigureComponent</codeInline>
method in the component.  See the help file for more details.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added a <codeInline>SyntaxFilters</codeInline> property that lets you specify
which languages appear in the Syntax section of the help topics and, for
the Prototype presentation style, the dropdown in the upper right of the
topics.  It can be set to CSharp, VisualBasic, CPlusPlus, JSharp, a
combination of those values, All to include them all, Standard (the
default) for C#, VB.NET, and C++ only, or to None to remove the Syntax
section entirely.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added the <codeInline>CppCommentsFixup</codeInline> project property to work
around an issue with methods that take generics as parameters in XML
comments files created by the C++ compiler (it doesn't match the other .NET
compilers' naming conventions).</listItem>

    <listItem>The <codeInline>FrameworkVersion</codeInline> property is now always saved in
the project to prevent building against the wrong version when a project is
edited on two different systems, one with a more recent version of .NET
than another.  It also defaults to .NET 2.0 for new projects rather than
the most recent framework version on the system which may be .NET 3.0
to prevent unexpected problems.  If you need .NET 3.0, you must select it
manually.</listItem>

    <listItem>The <codeInline>HelpTitle</codeInline> property is now displayed in the help
topics at the top of the page where "Reference Library" used to be.</listItem>

    <listItem>The <codeInline>ObsoleteAttribute</codeInline>, <codeInline>FlagsAttribute</codeInline>,
and <codeInline>SerializableAttribute</codeInline> are now always included even if
<codeInline>DocumentAttributes</codeInline> is set to false. These provide useful
information and should not be filtered out.</listItem>

    <listItem>The <legacyBold>Preview and Arrange</legacyBold> dialog for additional content no
longer prompts for the project folder as it is maintained internally now.</listItem>

    <listItem>Code in <codeInline>&lt;pre&gt;</codeInline> tags in additional content HTML
files can be colorized by adding the colorizer attributes to them.  See the
<legacyBold>Syntax Highlighting &lt;pre&gt; Tag Content</legacyBold> topic for details.</listItem>

    <listItem>Modified the tool search to also try to find Sandcastle via the
<environmentVariable>DXROOT</environmentVariable> environment variable.</listItem>
