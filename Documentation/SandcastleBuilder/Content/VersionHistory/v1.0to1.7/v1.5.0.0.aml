      <title>Changes in This Release</title>
      <content>
<list class="bullet">
    <listItem>Added support for the June 2007 CTP of Sandcastle.</listItem>
    
    <listItem>Fixed a bug that caused a crash when removing private framework
field members.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug in the handling of <codeInline>&lt;exclude/&gt;</codeInline> that
caused it to also remove base class members when removing a type.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug when generating the website table of contents caused
by the angle brackets on nested generic types.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug in <codeInline>ShowMissingComponent</codeInline> caused by incorrect
handling of generic template parameter names.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed a bug in the code colorizer that caused it to match some
<codeInline>pre</codeInline> tags incorrectly.  Also fixed the "include file" regular
expression so that it didn't match similar looking managed C++ generic
declarations.</listItem>

    <listItem>Fixed inconsistent handling of the tab size property in both the code
colorizer and the code block component.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added managed C++ keywords to the C++ colorizer template.</listItem>
    
    <listItem>The list of assemblies to document is now maintained in sorted order.</listItem>
    
    <listItem>Added code to verify that <codeInline>OutputPath</codeInline> and
<codeInline>WorkingPath</codeInline> do not point to a root or well-known folder (i.e.
C:\ or My Documents) to prevent users from accidentally deleting everything
in it.</listItem>

    <listItem>Support was added for finding <codeInline>&lt;code&gt;</codeInline> tags with
closing <codeInline>&lt;/code&gt;</codeInline> tags in addition to the self-closing
tags for importing code blocks in additional content files.</listItem>

    <listItem>Support was added for merging two or more code snippets into a
single code example by nesting <codeInline>code</codeInline> tags within a parent
<codeInline>code</codeInline> tag.  Nested code tags are supported in XML comments and
additional content files. See the
<link xlink:href="7f03ba39-09f8-4320-bdbd-ed31a3bd885f" /> topic and
<link xlink:href="1863a4d7-61b6-4dde-862d-a358d0cfbd54" /> topic for details.</listItem>

    <listItem>The code colorizer was updated to be more flexible in matching
language IDs to rule sets.  It will now match the ID case-insensitively to
the ID or friendly name.  It will also match several common variations to
the correct rule sets (i.e. VB to VB.NET, CSharp to C#, etc.).</listItem>

    <listItem>Added a <codeInline>ShowMissingNamespaces</codeInline> project option so that
"missing namespace comments" messages in the help file can be suppressed if
not wanted.</listItem>

    <listItem>The website output option has been modified.  It no longer uses
a frame set. Instead, it uses a combination of <codeInline>DIV</codeInline>
tags, CSS, Javascript, and an <codeInline>IFRAME</codeInline> to display the
table of contents and the selected page.</listItem>

    <listItem>In addition, a couple of ASP.NET pages are supplied that should
work more efficiently than the basic <legacyBold>Index.html</legacyBold> page.
The main <legacyBold>Index.aspx</legacyBold> page only loads the root nodes
for the table of contents when first displayed.  Ajax calls are used to load
child nodes dynamically when they are first expanded (done using
<legacyBold>FillNode.aspx</legacyBold>).  A <localUri>Web.config</localUri>
file is included that contains some necessary namespace declarations for the
pages.  The pages use inline code so there shouldn't be any need to compile
them before deployment.</listItem>

    <listItem>When viewing the ASP.NET index page, full-text search is also
available.  The search results are returned using an Ajax call to the
<legacyBold>SearchHelp.aspx</legacyBold> page.  Search results are sorted by rank (most likely
match first) by default or they can be sorted by title.</listItem>

    <listItem>Expanded the output viewing options to let you choose which format
to view when multiple formats have been built.  This includes the ASP.NET
website option using the .NET 2.0 development web server (IIS not
required).</listItem>

    <listItem>The <legacyBold>Verbose Logging</legacyBold> option on the <legacyBold>Documentation</legacyBold> menu
has been removed.  There is now a <legacyBold>User Preferences</legacyBold> option on the
<legacyBold>Project</legacyBold> menu that lets you edit non-project related user preferences
such as the verbose logging option, an MS Help 2 viewer application,
and the port to use for the ASP.NET development web server used to view
website output.</listItem>

    <listItem>The output and log viewing options were modified so that you can
view the results from a prior session without having to do a build after
restarting the help file builder.</listItem>

    <listItem>Added some more common problems and solutions to the FAQ.</listItem>
    
    <listItem>Localized versions of the shared content files were removed.  See the
1.6.0.0 release notes for the reasons and information on the new
implementation.</listItem>
