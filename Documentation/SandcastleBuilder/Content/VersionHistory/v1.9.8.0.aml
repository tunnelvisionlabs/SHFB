				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Removed the <codeInline>ModifyHelpTopicFilenames</codeInline> build step as API topic file
naming is now handled entirely by the new <localUri>AddFilenames.xsl</localUri> transformation in Sandcastle.  If
you have plug-ins that rely on the removed build step, they will need to be updated.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Renamed the <codeInline>CopyStandardContent</codeInline> build step to
<codeInline>CopyStandardHelpContent</codeInline> and moved it to run after the <codeInline>ExtractingHtmlInfo</codeInline>
build step.  This allows for standard content (presentation style images, scripts, style sheets, etc.) to be
defined in the presentation style definition files and allows templates within those content files to have
substitution tags replaced properly.  This should only affect plug-ins that used the
<codeInline>CopyStandardContent</codeInline> build step as an execution point.  Update them to use the new build
step and make other adjustments if the plug-ins or build components expect the content to be there earlier in the
build.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The presentation style definition file has been updated to include an entry to copy the website
content files from the help file builder.  If you have created custom presentation style files and generate
website output, update your definition files accordingly.  This allows for presentation styles to contain
modified versions of the default help file builder website files or they can completely replace them with
something else.</para>

			<title>Other Changes in This Release</title>
			<content>
				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the topic previewer to prevent parser failures on invalid/unrecognized URL values.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed up the code used to find tools in the Program Files folder so that it works regardless of
OS type and special folder name.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed a bug in the VSPackage that caused a crash after opening and closing a file that was not
a member of any project in the active solution.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the Assembly Binding Redirection plug-in so that it runs in partial builds and fully
qualifies redirection configuration filenames when written to <localUri>MRefBuilder.config</localUri>.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed a bug in the XML comments file class reported by AMainka so that it detects when nodes
are removed.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the determination of the default topic so that it searches for a file in nested topics
when the parent topic is an empty container node.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed documentation source project file handling so that it favors the <codeInline>TargetName</codeInline>
property over the <codeInline>AssemblyName</codeInline> property so that it works with C++ projects that have a
different assembly name from the project filename.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed documentation source project file handling to account for the
<codeInline>GenerateProjectSpecificOutputFolder</codeInline> property being set to true which modifies how the
<codeInline>OutDir</codeInline> property is set for the build.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the Additional Reference Links and Version Builder plug-ins so that they correctly clone
the subprojects to avoid modifying the underlying MSBuild project which may be loaded in Visual Studio.  This
prevents the changes they make to the subprojects from propagating to the Visual Studio copy.</para>
					</listItem>
					
					<listItem>
						<para>Added code to check for additional issues with invalid characters in the MS Help Viewer help
title and vendor name.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Relaxed the reserved folder restriction to allow project output and working folders to reside
in subfolders beneath the Desktop folder.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Reworked the file system watcher in the standalone GUI to ignore changed files in the output
path and working folder of the current project.  This greatly reduces the number of files to check if a build is
in progress when the GUI regains the focus.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Merged a patch from Seng Lin to convert <localUri>GenerateRefInfo.proj</localUri> hint paths to
relative paths if the fully qualified path length exceeds the system maximums.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for spell checking files in the text editor window in the standalone GUI.  Use
the new tool bar button or Ctrl+Shift+K to invoke the spell checker tool window.  A separate package is available
to spell check projects in Visual Studio (see the guided installer for details).</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added an <ui>Open with Text Editor</ui> context menu option in the Project Explorer window to
allow opening files such as content layout files with the text editor so that they can be spell checked.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Renamed <localUri>Index.html</localUri> to <localUri>index.html</localUri> so that it can be
found by case-sensitive Unix web servers.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added code to <localUri>TOC.js</localUri> to prevent it showing pages outside of the current
site's folder when using the topic query string option.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Merged changes from Dave Dansey into <localUri>TOC.js</localUri> to sync to TOC when the topic
URL parameter is used.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Merged code contributed by Procomp Solutions Oy that improves performance for large tables of
content in <localUri>FillNode.aspx</localUri> by using XML serialization and caching.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added code to the standalone GUI to allow saving project state when the user file is marked as
hidden.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the VSPackage installer to support installation in Visual Studio 2013.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for the .NETFramework 4.5.1, .NETCore 4.5.1, and .NETPortable 4.6 frameworks.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Adjusted how child processes are killed when a build is aborted to try and prevent killing
unrelated processes from a separate, concurrent build.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Enabled window selection commands for use during a build in the standalone GUI.  Also enabled
switching between project property categories in the Properties window during a build to allow seeing what values
are in effect.</para>
					</listItem>
