			<title>Breaking Changes</title>
			<content>
				<para>The first two changes affect all users.  The remaining changes will only affect those that have
created custom build components, syntax generators, plug-ins, and presentation styles.  Carefully read the
following items as you will need to update your components based on these changes.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Moved the colorizer files from the Sandcastle Builder GUI project to the Presentation Styles
project where they are a better fit.  This changes the location of the colorizer files and places them under the
<localUri>PresentationStyles\</localUri> folder.  If you have added the Code Block Component to your project, you
will need to remove it and re-add it or update the configuration to add the "PresentationStyles\" folder ahead of
the "Colorizer\" folder in the configuration file location options.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added code to the Resolve Reference Links Component and Copy From Index Command to check
for and use broken explicitly implemented interface (EII) member IDs if the correct one is not found.  This works
around a bug in the base framework XML comments file member IDs and the MSDN content service IDs for certain
inherited EII members.</para>

						<alert class="important">
							<para>You will need to delete the content ID cache in order for this change to have any effect.
See the <legacyBold>User Configuration Settings and Cache Files</legacyBold> section of the
<link xlink:href="a24489fb-45d6-46f4-9eaa-9a9c4e0919b2#BuildSettings" /> topic for details.</para>
						</alert>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Moved the syntax generator resource items to the syntax generator BuildAssembler project.  This
allows the syntax generators to be more self-contained and allows them to be created without requiring changes to
the presentation styles.</para>
					</listItem>
					
					<listItem>
						<para>Added a new <codeInline>ResourceItemFileLocation</codeInline> property to the syntax generator
factory interface. This is implemented to return the path to the resource item file associated with the syntax
generator containing its localized text for titles, messages, metadata, etc. This allows creation of
self-contained syntax generators that require no modifications to the presentation styles with which they will be
used.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the Open XML, VS2010, and VS2013 presentation styles so that they are no longer
dependent on the syntax generator items and IDs.</para>
					</listItem>
				</list>

		<section address="Help2Deprecated">
			<title>MS Help 2 (HxS) Format Support Deprecated</title>
			<content>
				<para>Effective with this release, support for the MS Help 2 (HxS) help file format used in Visual Studio
2008 and earlier has been deprecated.  It is just too cumbersome to maintain a separate environment with an older
version of Visual Studio and its SDKs in which to test this obsolete help format.  Going forward, no further
updates or fixes will be made to support it.  Any new presentation styles created in the future will not support
it either.</para>

		<section address="OtherChanges">
			<title>Other Changes Made in This Release</title>
			<content>
				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>A NuGet package is now available (<legacyBold>EWSoftware.SHFB</legacyBold>) to allow for
<link xlink:href="50ad2c8c-5004-4b4c-a77f-97b8c403c9f2">build server deployments</link> and local project copies
of the tools that can be checked into source control.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the Version Builder plug-in so that it correctly generates the version IDs used in the
configuration file and the label resource items.  It is now possible to have "prior" projects that use different
framework labels with a version number that matches the "current" project.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the Additional Reference Links and Version Builder plug-ins so that they correctly apply
the <codeInline>Configuration</codeInline> and <codeInline>Platform</codeInline> properties to the sub-projects
to ensure they are evaluated properly in project properties when the sub-projects are loaded.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the VSPackage IntelliSense provider by adding "langword" as a prefix to the language
keyword entries to prevent an odd crash in VS 2013.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Merged changes from Sam Harwell to enable the Visual Studio C# documentation completion
provider to work properly if the Roslyn package is installed which uses a different implementation of
IntelliSense.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the Lightweight TOC plug-in so that it adds some script to the default topic to expand
the root node when the first node has children. This prevents it from looking like only one namespace was
documented because the root node is collapsed.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the Lightweight TOC plug-in so that it transforms the help title property value to ensure
substitution tags in the value are replaced.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the DBCS Fix plug-in so that it copies the Help 1 content to the output folder for
inclusion in the localized copy of the content.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the XPath Reflection File Filter plug-in so that it runs before transforming the
reflection file content and generating the BuildAssembler manifest file.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Applied a fix from Kalyan00 to the Sandcastle HTML Extract tool so that it correctly saves
files in the localized and original locations with the proper encodings.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Set the maximum degree of parallelism in the Sandcastle HTML Extract tool to 20 threads per
processor.  This is configurable but is not currently exposed.  It can be adjusted by adding a
<codeInline>MaxDegreeOfParallelism</codeInline> property to the HTML extract project template and passing it to
the task if needed.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>As suggested by Kaylan00, the DBCS Fix plug-in has been changed so that the path to the
<application>SBAppLocale</application> tool is optional.  If not specified, the plug-in will issue a warning but
will run.  In such cases, only the localization fixes applied by the Sandcastle HTML Extract tool will be in
effect.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for <link xlink:href="48f5a893-acde-4e50-8c17-72b83d9c3f9d">NamespaceGroupDoc</link>
classes in XML comments files to add documentation to namespace group topics.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added the <link xlink:href="17d977a6-e3dc-4ef4-9bbf-718ef4823854" /> to allow fixing up member
IDs in XML comments files that do not match the reflection data due to quirks in the various compilers.  This can
be used in place of or in conjunction with the C++ Fix-Up project property.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added the <link xlink:href="1fcdf9d3-06fb-4a7b-a584-f55b6ea5baae" /> that can be used to
suppress the help file build steps and produce only the IntelliSense XML comments files when used in conjunction
with the <link xlink:href="5d546511-6aec-455a-ba09-9daffb124c6d" />.  This is useful for supporting projects that
need IntelliSense XML comments files but do not contribute content to the help file directly (i.e. those in the
Version Builder plug-in configuration).</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for installing the VSPackage in Visual Studio 2015 Preview and added support for
the .NET Framework versions 4.5.2 and 4.5.3.</para>
					</listItem>
