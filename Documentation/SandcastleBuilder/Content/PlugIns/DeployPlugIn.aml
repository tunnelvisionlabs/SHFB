    <introduction>
      <para>This plug-in is used to deploy the resulting help file output to a
location other than the output folder (i.e. a file share, a web server, an FTP
site, etc.).  This plug-in will require configuration before it can be used.
The configuration options are as follows:</para>

    <entry>Delete source files after deploying them</entry>
    <entry>Check this box to delete the source help files after they have been
deployed.  This option applies to all help file formats built by the project
and deployed by the plug-in.</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>Help file format options</entry>
    <entry>For each help file format (HTML Help 1, MS Help 2, and website), you
can define a different set of deployment options.  Fill in the options for each
help file format built by the project.  The options are the same for all
formats and are described below.</entry>

<para>The following options are available for each help file format.</para>

    <entry>Target Location</entry>
    <entry><para>Enter the location to which the help file output should be
copied.  This can be a file path, a UNC path, or a URL for a website or FTP
site.  If a relative file path is specified, it will be relative to the project
folder.</para>

<alert class="note">
  <para><legacyBold>HTTP/FTP Limitation</legacyBold>: Be aware that there is a
limitation when deploying output to an HTTP or FTP URL.  Any subfolders in the
source website and/or destination URL must already exist in the destination
website or FTP site.  If not, the deployment will fail.  If possible, deploy to
a file or UNC path that maps to the URL as they do not have this limitation.</para>

<alert class="security">
  <para>Using HTTP for uploads is not recommended as you must grant write
permissions to the folders which is a security risk.</para>

    <entry>Use default credentials</entry>
    <entry>If this checkbox is checked, the current user's credentials at
build time will be used to upload the resulting files to the given URL.
If running this on a build server and/or authentication is required, uncheck
this box and supply a user name and password.</entry>

    <entry>Use Proxy Server</entry>
    <entry>If the upload of the files fails and you are behind a proxy server,
you may need to supply proxy server credentials.  Uncheck this box to enter
the proxy server name and credentials.</entry>

this box and enter a user name and password.</entry>

<para>You only need to enter information for the help file formats that are
built by the project and/or that you want to deploy.  If a target location is
left blank for any given format, deployment of that format will be skipped.</para>
