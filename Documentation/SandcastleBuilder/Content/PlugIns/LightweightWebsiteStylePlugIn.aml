		<introduction>
			<para>This plug-in adds lightweight table of contents and search elements to each topic in website builds.
It is utilized by newer presentation styles such as the VS2013 style that contain the necessary elements that it
looks for in order to insert the required elements.</para>

			<alert class="note">
				<para>This plug-in currently has no configurable options and is hidden from the Plug-Ins property page.
It is added automatically as a dependency plug-in at build time by the presentation styles that utilize it.</para>

			<title>Advantages of the Lightweight Style</title>
			<content>
				<para>The lightweight website style has several advantages over the frame-based website format used by
the older presentation styles.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Since the frame is omitted, the browser's address bar always contains the direct URL to the
topic being viewed.  This makes it much simpler to create links to topics from external sites.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Site performance is improved.  This is especially true of sites that formerly used the old
<localUri>index.html</localUri> page that contained the full table of contents.  In the lightweight style, each
page contains only the table of content fragment that it needs to navigate to nearby topics.  The content of
collapsed topic nodes in the table of contents tree are loaded on demand.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>ASP.NET or PHP is no longer required for viewing or searching the site.  This allows for the
sites to be hosted on servers that can only serve static content.  ASP.NET or PHP will be utilized for site
searches if available since they provide better performance.  If not, a client-side script implementation is
available for use.</para>

			<title>Known Issues</title>
			<content>
				<para>There are a few issues to be aware of when using a presentation style that utilizes the lightweight
website style.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>When you switch to a presentation style that uses the lightweight website style, it will break
existing links to topics from external sites.  Correcting those links is simple.  All that needs to be done is to
remove the <localUri>"Index.aspx?topic="</localUri> or <localUri>"?topic="</localUri> query string section from
the URLs.  For example:</para>

<code language="none" title=" ">

						<para>As noted above, if ASP.NET or PHP is not available, site searches will be performed using a
client-side script implementation.  While it does work, it is not optimal since it has to download the keyword
index files used for the search to the client.  The files are cached after their first use but this will slow
initial searches, especially on larger sites and when the browser cache is cleared.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The index feature has been dropped and is not available.</para>

			<title>Requirements</title>
			<content>
				<para>If you create a new presentation style that utilizes this plug-in, the following requirements must
be met.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>A shared content file must contain a resource item with the id <codeInline>resizeToolTip</codeInline>
that defines the tool tip used for the resizing element.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>A <codeInline>div</codeInline> element must appear in each topic with a <codeInline>class</codeInline>
attribute value of <codeInline>pageHeader</codeInline>.  The search box will be inserted inside this element.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>A <codeInline>div</codeInline> element must appear in each topic with a <codeInline>class</codeInline>
attribute value of <codeInline>topicContent</codeInline>.  The element containing the table of contents fragment
and resizing element will be inserted ahead of it.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Image, style sheet, and script resources used by the lightweight table of contents and search
elements must be included as part of the website output for the presentation style.  See the VS2013 presentation
style for an example, specifically the files in the <localUri>.\Web</localUri> folder and the additional style
sheet <localUri>.\styles\branding-Website.css</localUri>.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The BuildAssembler configuration files must include the <codeInline>Additional Header Resources
Component</codeInline> to insert the necessary resource items and metadata into each topic based on the file
format.  See the VS2013 presentation style configuration files for an example.</para>
