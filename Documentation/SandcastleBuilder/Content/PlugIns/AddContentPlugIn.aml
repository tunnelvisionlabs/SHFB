    <introduction>
	<para>This plug-in can be used to build a help file consisting of nothing
but conceptual and additional content items.  All documentation sources and
references in the project are ignored.  Since this results in a much faster
build, it is useful for proofreading your additional content without having to
build all the API topics.</para>

	<para>This plug-in contains no configuration options.  It simply suppresses
several of the build steps that generate API topics.  Since the API topic
generation is suppressed, links to API topics in the conceptual and additional
content files will be rendered as bold, non-clickable links.  All other
content features such as colorized code blocks, project and shared content item
replacement, etc. are still handled.</para>
