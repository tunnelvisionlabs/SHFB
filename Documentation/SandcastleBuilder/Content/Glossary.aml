          <para>An extra file included in the help file used to define extra content or used as a supporting
file.  This can be an HTML topic, an image, script, stylesheet, etc.  In earlier releases of the help file
builder, this was the way non-API content was included in the help file.  The preferred method of including such
content now is to use conceptual content.  Although still supported, the additional content features of the help
file builder are now considered deprecated.</para>

          <para>A custom build component that can be used to colorize code, add line numbering and/or collapsible
section, and import code from working source code files.  It can be used in both conceptual and reference builds.
The component is integrated with the <token>SHFB</token> and is also available as a standalone component from the
same project site for use in other tools or your own build scripts.</para>

file (C#, VB.NET, or J#), a Visual Studio solution file containing one or more of the noted project types, or a
wildcard item that results in a list of one or more of the previously mentioned file types.  These are used to
produce API documentation in a help project.  At least one assembly must be specified as a documentation source
in order to produce API help content.  Documentation sources are managed using the <legacyBold>Documentation

          <para>Sandcastle is a set of tools produced by Microsoft that can be used to build help files for .NET
managed libraries, conceptual content, or a mix of both.  Microsoft officially discontinued development in
October 2012.  The Sandcastle tools have been merged with the <token>SHFB</token> project and are developed and
supported there now as part of that project.</para>

          <para>The <token>SHFB</token> is a standalone tool used to automate Sandcastle.  It consists of a GUI
front end that helps you manage and build help file projects.  It uses a standard MSBuild format project file
which can also be built from the command line using MSBuild or integrated into Visual Studio builds or other
build scripts to produce a help file when your application projects are built.  In addition, it provides a set of
additional features beyond those supplied with Sandcastle that can improve your help file and make it easier to
deploy.  A Visual Studio integration package is also available for it that integrates the project management
and build features into Visual Studio 2010 or later.</para>

          <para>A token is used as a replaceable tag within a topic and is represented using a
<codeInline>token</codeInline> element.  The inner text of the element is a token name.  The tokens are defined

phrase or external link.</para>
