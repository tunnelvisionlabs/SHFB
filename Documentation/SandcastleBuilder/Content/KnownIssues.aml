						<para>Full Microsoft Help Viewer support has been implemented within the Sandcastle Help File Builder.
However, please note that only the <legacyBold>VS2010</legacyBold> and <legacyBold>VS2005</legacyBold>
presentation styles contain the necessary resources and XSL transformations to output the necessary metadata.
This was Microsoft's decision as noted in the June 2010 release:</para>

						<quote>The <legacyBold>Hana</legacyBold> presentation is not supported because its support was
already dropped in the latest Sandcastle code before our changes.  The <legacyBold>Prototype</legacyBold>
presentation is not supported because we consider it outdated, existing only for compatibility purposes even in
the earlier Sandcastle versions.</quote>

						<para>Support for the <legacyBold>Hana</legacyBold> and <legacyBold>Prototype</legacyBold> styles is
present in the help file builder but the Sandcastle transformations and resource files will need updating in
order to support the generation of Microsoft Help Viewer files with them.  There are no plans to do this and it
is recommended that you switch to the <legacyBold>VS2010</legacyBold> or <legacyBold>VS2005</legacyBold>
presentation style.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The deprecated raw HTML additional content model, site maps, and file system-based table of
contents generation is not supported for help viewer output.  All additional topics must be in the form of MAML
<link xlink:href="3d4edd2d-7883-4508-b9d2-bd7b4d848b0d">conceptual content</link> and must be defined in a
content layout file.  There are too many requirements of the format to support raw HTML files and the deprecated
additional content options.  The installer for the Sandcastle tools contains an HTML to MAML converter utility
if you need one.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Microsoft's Help Viewer Power Tool introduces some changes that are incompatible with content
that uses the <codeInline>SelfBranded=True</codeInline> attribute that Sandcastle will emit in the
<legacyBold>VS2005</legacyBold> presentation style.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Microsoft Help Viewer content generated with the <legacyBold>VS2005</legacyBold> presentation
style will produce content that in some contexts produces two vertical scrollbars.</para>

						<para>Not all build errors and warnings have been documented yet.  You will recognize these by a
<placeholder>TODO:</placeholder> comment where the introduction should be or in the topic body.  If you need
help for one of these errors or warnings, please ask in the Discussion area of the <token>SHFB</token> project
at CodePlex.</para>

						<para>The standalone GUI does not support source control providers.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Linked items (file items in which the physical file is located in a folder outside the
project's folder) are supported but cannot be added from the standalone GUI.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>COM object references are supported in the projects but they cannot be added from the
standalone GUI.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Due to their non-standard format, managed C++ projects from Visual Studio 2008 and before are
not supported as documentation sources or project references.  Add the targets and references individually.
Visual Studio 2010 and later use a standard MSBuild format for C++ projects and they are supported as
documentation sources.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>The display of editor windows, the Properties window, or the Preview window sometimes gets
corrupted such that the content area disappears or is not sized correctly in the tabbed area of the standalone
GUI.  Selecting a different file tab and switching back to the affected tab, closing and reopening the affected
file/window, or resizing the width of a docked window to force a repaint will work around the issue.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Renaming a folder or file in the Project Explorer in the standalone GUI will not rename any
open document editors associated with the renamed folder or file.  If necessary, do a <ui>File | Save As</ui> to
save it in the right location or just close and reopen the file if it has not been changed.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>A standard tree control is used in the Project Explorer window in the standalone GUI and does
not allow selection of multiple tree nodes.  As such, all operations within it only affect the currently selected
node.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>When doing search and replace in a text editor window in the standalone GUI, the highlight on
the found text is not always retained when doing a subsequent search/replace.  The cursor is positioned correctly
though.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>In the standalone GUI, when using the dropdown on the editor window's "various elements" toolbar
button (shows <ui>alert</ui> as the default action when first opened), the cursor occasionally disappears from
the editor window after the dropdown closes even though it has the focus and text can be entered.  Change the
focus to another window and back to restore it.</para>
