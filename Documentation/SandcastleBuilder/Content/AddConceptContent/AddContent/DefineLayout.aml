      <para>The following information only applies if a site map file is <legacyUnderline>not</legacyUnderline>
defined in the project.  When using a site map file, its layout definition overrides all file-level definitions.
See the <link xlink:href="3dd5fe3b-1bc3-42e5-8900-56165e3f9aed" /> topic for details.</para>

				<para>The additional content model of adding extra content to a help file has been deprecated.  While it
will continue to be supported and will not be removed, it will not receive any more features or updates.  Going
forward, <link xlink:href="3d4edd2d-7883-4508-b9d2-bd7b4d848b0d">conceptual content</link> is the preferred
method of adding non-reference content to the help file.  The additional content feature can still be used to
<link xlink:href="77d2d693-db84-4ae3-a84c-e33c71f92e9a">override stock content</link> and add supporting files to
the help file.</para>

    </introduction>

<section>
  <content>
		<para>All HTML files copied as additional content will automatically be added to the help file's table
of contents.  Subfolders will also create folder entries within the table of contents and the HTML files within
them become children of the folder entry in the table of contents.  This makes it fairly simple to create
hierarchical content with matching table of contents entries.  The table of contents will mimic the folder
structure on disk.</para>

		<para>The help file builder scans each HTML file for the following tags and specially formatted comments that
allow you to define the related properties of the table of contents entries.  They can appear anywhere in the
file.</para>

		<list class="bullet">
			<listItem>
				<para><codeInline>&lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;</codeInline> - The value from the title tag in
the HTML file is used as the title in the table of contents.  If no title tag is found, the filename without the
path and extension is used as the title.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para><codeInline>&lt;!-- @TOCExclude --&gt;</codeInline> - This special comment can be used to exclude
the page from the table of contents.  The file will still be copied to the output folder but will not appear in
the table of contents.  Instead, a link to it must exist from another help page.  This is also useful for setting
the title and sort order on folder entries without associating a page with the folder entry in the table of
contents.  See below for more information.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para><codeInline>&lt;!-- @DefaultTopic --&gt;</codeInline> - This special comment is used to indicate
that the page should be selected as the default topic for the help file.  If multiple pages contain this comment,
the last one seen will be used as the default topic.  If no additional content items are defined or none are
marked as the default topic, the root namespaces page is selected as the default topic.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para><codeInline>&lt;!-- @SortOrder nnn --&gt;</codeInline> - This special comment is used to set the
sort order of the item within the group where "nnn" represents an integer value.  The "group" is all other
additional content table of contents entries at the same level as the current item.  In the absence of a sort
order indicator, table of contents entries are sorted alphabetically.  By specifying a sort order, you can
rearrange the entries in a different order.  Items within a group that have the same sort order value will also
sort alphabetically.  Items without a sort order indicator are placed below those with a sort order indicator and
are sorted alphabetically.</para>
			</listItem>

			<listItem>
				<para><codeInline>&lt;!-- @SplitTOC --&gt;</codeInline> - This special comment is used to indicate that
the table of contents should be split by the API content.  It is only valid on table of contents entries that
appear at the root level.  All table of contents entries prior to the entry with this tag will appear before the
API content.  The entry with the tag and all entries following it will appear after the API content.</para>
			</listItem>
		</list>

		<para>By default, folder entries in the table of contents will not have any HTML page associated with them
and will not show a specific page in the help file when selected.  The title will be the folder name and they
will be sorted alphabetically within the same group of items below any items that have a sort order indicator.
You can control these properties for folder entries by placing an HTML file in the folder that has the same name
as the folder (i.e. place a file called <localUri>OtherContent.html</localUri> in the <localUri>OtherContent\</localUri>
folder to set its properties).  If the <codeInline>@TOCExclude</codeInline> comment does not appear in the file,
the associated page will be displayed when the folder is selected in the table of contents.  Below are a couple
of examples:</para>

<code lang="xml" title="OtherContent\OtherContent.html">
&lt;!-- @TOCExclude --&gt;
&lt;!-- @SortOrder 3 --&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Other Content&lt;/title&gt;
</code>

		<para>The example above sets the sort order and title of the folder entry but does not display anything when
the folder is selected as it contains the <codeInline>@TOCExclude</codeInline> comment.</para>

<code lang="xml" title="FolderWithPage\FolderWithPage.html">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Folder Entry with a Content Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;!-- @SortOrder 2 --&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
This is a content page for a folder entry in the
table of contents.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>

		<para>The example above sets the sort order and title of the folder entry and specifies content that will be
displayed when the folder is selected as the <codeInline>@TOCExclude</codeInline> comment is omitted.  It could
also be made the default topic by adding the <codeInline>@DefaultTopic</codeInline>
comment.</para>

  </content>
