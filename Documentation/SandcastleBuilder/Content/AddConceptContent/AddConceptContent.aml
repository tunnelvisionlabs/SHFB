    <introduction>
      <para>In versions of the help file builder prior to version 1.7.0.0,
the additional content properties were used to add files to the project to
define additional help content that would appear in the table of contents and
to add other items such as image files and additional style sheets.  As an
alternative to basic HTML files, you could also create XML files with a
<localUri>.topic</localUri> extension that would be ran through an XSL
transformation to give them the basic look and feel of the presentation style
that was selected.  However, using the basic transformations, the topics lacked
several features present in the reference content such as collapsible sections
and the language filter and they could not take advantage of build components
to resolve links to reference and online content.</para>

  <content><para>Starting with version 1.7.0.0, the help file builder supports
conceptual content.  This is similar in nature to additional content in that it
allows you to add non-reference content to the help file that will appear in
the table of contents.  However, instead of HTML files or <localUri>.topic</localUri>
files that contain HTML, conceptual content uses topic files that contain
Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML).  This is basically XML conforming
to a well defined schema that describes the structure of the conceptual content
much like XML comments describe the structure of the code comments. There is no
layout or style information within the MAML files. Instead, they are ran
through a series of XSL transformations using Sandcastle's
<application>BuildAssembler</application> tool similar to the reference (API)
content so that they match it in appearance and features.</para>

	<para>MAML is quite different than HTML but it does offer many of the same
capabilities.  The main difference is that the XSL transformations are
responsible for applying the style and formatting, not the elements in the
MAML topics. It does take some getting used to but the end result is well
worth it.  The look of the conceptual topics is much more consistent with that
of the reference topics. As such, preference will be given to conceptual
content when adding features to the help file builder.  While it will continue
to support the older additional content models, they will not receive any
further enhancements.</para>
