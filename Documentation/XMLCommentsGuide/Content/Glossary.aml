          <para>Sandcastle is a set of tools produced by Microsoft that can be used to build help files for .NET
managed libraries, conceptual content, or a mix of both.  Microsoft officially discontinued development in
October 2012.  The Sandcastle tools have been merged with the <token>SHFB</token> project and are developed and
supported there now as part of that project.</para>

          <para>The <token>SHFB</token> is a standalone tool used to automate Sandcastle.  It consists of a GUI
front end that helps you manage and build help file projects.  It uses a standard MSBuild format project file
which can also be built from the command line using MSBuild or integrated into Visual Studio builds or other
build scripts to produce a help file when your application projects are built.  In addition, it provides a set of
additional features beyond those supplied with Sandcastle that can improve your help file and make it easier to
deploy.  A Visual Studio integration package is also available for it that integrates the project management
and build features into Visual Studio 2010 or later.</para>

          <para>A token is used as a replaceable tag within a topic and is represented using a
<codeInline>token</codeInline> element.  The inner text of the element is a token name.  The tokens are defined
in a separate token file.  They are an easy way to represent common items that you use regularly such as a common
phrase or external link.</para>
