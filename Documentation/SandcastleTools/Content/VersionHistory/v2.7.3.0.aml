						<para>Reworked the BuildAssembler execution process to allow for parallel executon of component code.
Components are still initialized and topics built sequentially for the time being but parallelism can be utilized
now and is used in certain components when they are initialized.</para>

					<listItem>
						<para>Reworked the BuildAssembler message logger to allow for parallel executon of component code
without contention for the console when logging messages.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a warning count to BuildAssembler which is displayed at the end of the build.</para>

				<alert class="note">
					<para>A number of these are breaking changes.  However, most people will be unaffected unless they have
created custom build components or syntax generators.  These changes were necessary in order to make the API more
accessible and to make it easier to derive build components from existing ones without having to reimplement a
lot of the internal supporting classes.</para>
				</alert>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Deleted <codeInline>CodeReference</codeInline>, <codeInline>LiveExampleComponent</codeInline>,
and <codeInline>WdxResolveConceptualLinksComponent</codeInline> as they appear to be for internal Microsoft use
and do not appear to have much use for non-Microsoft users.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Deleted the classes in the <codeInline>BuildComponents</codeInline> namespace from the
BuildComponents project as they were unused.  These were replaced by the like-named classes in the
<codeInline>Microsoft.Ddue.Tools</codeInline> namespace.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Deleted <codeInline>IntellisenseComponent2</codeInline> and replaced
<codeInline>IntellisenseComponent</codeInline> with the version from the Sandcastle Help File Builder.  Added the
<codeInline>IntelliSenseComponent</codeInline> configuration dialog which can be used by front end tools such as
the Sandcastle Help File Builder to edit the component's configuration.
						</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Moved <codeInline>InheritDocumentationComponent</codeInline> into the main BuildComponents
project and deleted the CopyComponents assembly as it was the only one in it.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Moved the syntax writer classes into the SyntaxComponents assembly with their related classes.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Moved all of the snippet related classes into their own namespace.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Moved all of the target related classes into their own namespace.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Moved all of the command related classes into their own namespace.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Made all of the supporting classes public.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Made all reference link target classes serializable.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Cleaned up and refactored the code where necessary in almost all of build components.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a new <codeInline>CopyCommand</codeInline> abstract base class in BuildAssembler to make
creating new copy commands possible.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a new <codeInline>IndexedCache</codeInline> abstract base class for use by the
<codeInline>CopyFromIndexComponent</codeInline> and its subcomponents for the index data.  This also allows
derived components to implement alternate caching mechanisms.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Made <codeInline>TargetDictionary</codeInline> an abstract base class and added
<codeInline>InMemoryTargetDictionary</codeInline> as the basic implementation.  This allows alternate
implementations that use a different storage mechanism for the target data.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Reimplemented how reference link targets are loaded and stored.  This allows for sharing target
data independent of link type across multiple instances of <codeInline>ResolveReferenceLinksComponent2</codeInline>
reducing memory requirements and initialization time when building multiple output formats.  The new
implementation also allows caching of the information.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Reworked the target dictionaries to allow for loading of target information in parallel to
speed initialization up a bit.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Renamed the <codeInline>IndexedDocumentCache</codeInline> to <codeInline>InMemoryIndexedCache</codeInline>
and reworked it to support filtering by namespace to reduce the amount of reflection data that it needs to load
and also added support for loading the index files in parallel.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>In <codeInline>CopyFromIndexComponent</codeInline>, added a virtual method to create the index
caches, added code to dispose of them when done, and exposed the context via a protected property.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a <codeInline>Dispose</codeInline> method to <codeInline>CloneComponent</codeInline> to
properly dispose of all components in each branch.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Simplified the <codeInline>FileCreatedEventArgs</codeInline> and updated the
<codeInline>HxFGeneraterComponent</codeInline> to make it responsible for figuring out where to put its files.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for MSDN content ID caching to the <codeInline>ResolveReferenceLinksComponent2</codeInline>.
The implementation allows derived classes to utilize backing stores other than the serialized binary file used by
default as long as the cache type implements <codeInline>IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</codeInline>. It also
allows sharing the cache across multiple instances of the component.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Regenerated the MTPS Content Service classes.  A decision was made to stay with the web service
as the authentication issues have well-known solutions (see <localUri>BuildAssembler.exe.config</localUri>).
Switching to a service type may introduce other authentication issues and since the web service works well
enough, it was left as-is.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for defining which namespace targets to load in <codeInline>ResolveReferenceLinksComponent2</codeInline>.
This prevents loading unnecessary namespaces saving some memory and initialization time.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><codeInline>ReferenceLinkComponent2</codeInline> and <codeInline>CopyFromIndexComponent</codeInline>
now report cache usage at the end of the build with diagnostic messages.  These can be used to help tune the
cache sizes if necessary especially in derived caching components.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for a <codeInline>renderReferenceLinks</codeInline> attribute to the
<codeInline>SyntaxComponent</codeInline> configuration's syntax element. By default the syntax component will not
render links to types in the syntax section (this is not supported anymore by MS Help Viewer 2.0).  By adding
this attribute to the configuration and setting it to true, you can turn them back on again if wanted.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a condition to the <codeInline>SyntaxComponent</codeInline>'s <codeInline>Apply</codeInline>
method to skip group, project, and namespace pages in which a syntax section is of no use.  This allows removal
of the <codeInline>IfThenComponent</codeInline> wrapper around it in the configuration files which wasn't using
an up-to-date condition anyway.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the Visual Basic and Visual Basic Usage syntax generators to omit the line continuation
character by default.  It can be enabled by adding the <codeInline>includeLineContinuation</codeInline> attribute
to the generator element and setting it to true.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Removed the use of <codeInline>RegexOptions.Compiled</codeInline> in <codeInline>ExampleComponent</codeInline>
which greatly improves its overall performance. The significant time and increased memory penalties outweighed
any performance benefits over the course of the build.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated <codeInline>DisplayComponent</codeInline> to output the content as a diagnostic message
using the <codeInline>WriteMessage</codeInline> method rather than just dumping it to the console.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated <codeInline>ValidateComponent</codeInline> to include the key in its warning messages.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Moved the <codeInline>MSHelpAttrComponent</codeInline> and <codeInline>ShowMissingComponent</codeInline>
from the Sandcastle Help File Builder into the Sandcastle BuildComponents project.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed up various issues in the BuildAssembler projects found by FxCop (too many to list).</para>
					</listItem>

			<title>Presentation Styles</title>
			<content>
				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Changed the <codeInline>title</codeInline> element in the presentation styles so that it shows
the qualified member name. This is required to provide unique titles for index entries. This does have the
side-effect of causing member titles in the MS Help Viewer TOC to be qualified with the class name as Help Viewer
no longer supports a <codeInline>TOCTitle</codeInline> metadata attribute like Help 2 did. Help for base
framework classes exhibits the same behavior so this appears to be by design.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the VS2010 style so that links work properly in Help 2.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed <localUri>VS2010\Branding\ps-body.xslt</localUri> so that it doesn't add a "./" relative
URL prefix to non-relative image URLs.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Commented out the templates in <localUri>VS2010\Branding\ps-body.xslt</localUri> that were
stripping style attributes. These appear to be for use with non-self-branded content which doesn't apply anymore.
Allowing the style attributes through fixes the problem of the "nobullet" list style not working.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated all presentation styles so that fields, properties, events, and methods include a
return type link even if no <codeInline>returns</codeInline> or <codeInline>value</codeInline> XML comments
element is present. This makes it consistent with MSDN and allows for the removal of the type links within the
Syntax section itself as the type links for the return value and parameter values are available elsewhere on the
page.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Deleted the unused reference and schema build configuration and XSL transformation files from
all presentation styles.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Removed the duplicate items from <localUri>shared_content_mshc.xml</localUri> leaving only the
overridden path elements. The MS Help Viewer configuration files where updated to include the
<localUri>shared_content.xml</localUri> file ahead of it.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the example and presentation style configuration files to reference
<codeInline>InheritDocumentationComponent</codeInline> in the BuildComponents assembly.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added the <codeInline>ShowMissingComponent</codeInline> resource items to the
<localUri>reference_content.xml</localUri> file in each presentation style.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for the <codeInline>markup</codeInline> element in
<localUri>main_sandcastle.xsl</localUri> in each presentation style.  This allows a block of HTML or other
elements such as <codeInline>include</codeInline> to pass through as-is to the topic.  This allows build
components to insert content before the <codeInline>TransformComponent</codeInline> runs and prevents it being
removed as unrecognized content by the XSL transformations. The conceptual transformations already allow this so
this makes the conceptual and reference builds consistent in supporting a <codeInline>markup</codeInline> element.</para>
