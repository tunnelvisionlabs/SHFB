			<title>Breaking Changes</title>
			<content>
				<para>The first two changes affect all users.  The remaining changes will only affect those that have
created custom build components, syntax generators, plug-ins, and presentation styles.  Carefully read the
following items as you will need to update your components based on these changes.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Moved the colorizer files from the Sandcastle Builder GUI project to the Presentation Styles
project where they are a better fit.  This changes the location of the colorizer files and places them under the
<localUri>PresentationStyles\</localUri> folder.  If you have added the Code Block Component to your project, you
will need to remove it and re-add it or update the configuration to add the "PresentationStyles\" folder ahead of
the "Colorizer\" folder in the configuration file location options.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added code to the Resolve Reference Links Component and Copy From Index Command to check
for and use broken explicitly implemented interface (EII) member IDs if the correct one is not found.  This works
around a bug in the base framework XML comments file member IDs and the MSDN content service IDs for certain
inherited EII members.</para>

						<alert class="important">
							<para>You will need to delete the content ID cache in order for this change to have any effect.
See the <legacyBold>User Configuration Settings and Cache Files</legacyBold> section of the <legacyBold>Special
Folder Locations</legacyBold> topic in the Sandcastle Help File Builder help file for details.</para>
						</alert>
					</listItem>
					
					<listItem>
						<para>Moved the syntax generator resource items to the syntax generator BuildAssembler project.  This
allows the syntax generators to be more self-contained and allows them to be created without requiring changes to
the presentation styles.</para>
					</listItem>
					
					<listItem>
						<para>Added a new <codeInline>ResourceItemFileLocation</codeInline> property to the syntax generator
factory interface. This is implemented to return the path to the resource item file associated with the syntax
generator containing its localized text for titles, messages, metadata, etc. This allows creation of
self-contained syntax generators that require no modifications to the presentation styles with which they will be
used.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the Open XML, VS2010, and VS2013 presentation styles so that they are no longer
dependent on the syntax generator items and IDs.</para>
					</listItem>

		<section address="Help2Deprecated">
			<title>MS Help 2 (HxS) Format Support Deprecated</title>
			<content>
				<para>Effective with this release, support for the MS Help 2 (HxS) help file format used in Visual Studio
2008 and earlier has been deprecated.  It is just too cumbersome to maintain a separate environment with an older
version of Visual Studio and its SDKs in which to test this obsolete help format.  Going forward, no further
updates or fixes will be made to support it.  Any new presentation styles created in the future will not support
it either.</para>

								<para>Added information to the XML Comments Guide about using <codeInline>NamespaceGroupDoc</codeInline>
classes.</para>

					<title>BuildAssembler and Build Components</title>

						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed a bug in the Syntax Component so that it does not crash if a syntax generator does
not specify any alternate IDs.</para>

								<para>Updated the syntax generators to write out method parameter attributes.</para>

				<section address="MRefBuilder">
					<title>MRefBuilder</title>
					<content>
						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed MRefBuilder so that it properly matches types and methods with generic parameters
under certain specific conditions.  Thanks to Jared Moore for reporting the issue with a test case.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed MRefBuilder so that it filters out duplicate member IDs from derived interfaces that
re-implement base members using the "new" keyword.  Thanks to rpcode for reporting the issue with a test case.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added a new namer component for Windows Store and Windows Phone frameworks that renames
certain core types that the compiler changes when building assemblies.  This ensures that the reflection data
matches the XML comments which contain the expected type names.  The new namer component is used automatically
when generating reflection data using a Windows Store or Windows Phone framework version.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added code to write method parameter attribute elements to the reflection information file.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added code to write out the value of literal (constant) fields to the reflection
information file.</para>

and/or collapsible sections are copied to the clipboard without those elements.</para>

								<para>Fixed the code contracts templates so that the inherited property member IDs in reference
links are rendered correctly.</para>

which was causing problems in Internet Explorer (reported by baerbradford).</para>
