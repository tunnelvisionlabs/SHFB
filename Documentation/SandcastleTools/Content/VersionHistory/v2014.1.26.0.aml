			<title>Breaking Changes</title>
			<content>
				<alert class="important">
					<para>The Sandcastle tools are now installed as part of the Sandcastle Help File Builder and there is
no longer a separate installer for them.  As such, you will need to manually remove the prior release of the
Sandcastle tools.  Leaving them installed will not cause any issues as the new release is located in a different
folder.  However, removing them will avoid any confusion in the future.</para>
				</alert>

				<para>The majority of the following changes will only affect those that have created custom build
components, syntax generators, and presentation styles.  If you have, carefully read the following items as you
will need to update your components to work with the new Managed Extensibility Framework based implementation.</para>

				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Consolidated the Sandcastle Help File Builder and Sandcastle tools under a single, common
folder structure.  These changes were necessary in order to simplify deployment and support changes to the
component model.  Although combined, the Sandcastle tools can still be used independently of the help file
builder as in prior releases.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Since the tools have been consolidated under a single folder, the <environmentVariable>DXROOT</environmentVariable>
environment variable is no longer needed.  All tools now use the common <environmentVariable>SHFBROOT</environmentVariable>
environment variable instead where needed.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated all build components and syntax generators so that they are implemented using the
Manged Extensibility Framework (MEF).  A lot of code was moved into a new <localUri>Sandcastle.Core</localUri>
assembly that holds the base classes and MEF implementation classes common to all of the other projects in the
tool set.  This change allows for dynamic discoverability of components at runtime without the need for special
configuration files or file naming conventions.  It also allows for the use of project-specific components
located within a help file project's folder or one that it refers to through the new
<codeInline>ComponentPath</codeInline> property.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Presentation styles are now implemented as MEF components as well.  As with the other build
components, this allows for the same dynamic discoverability at runtime and project-specific presentation styles.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Changed the syntax generator IDs to their actual language names so that they are displayed
using the language name in the help file builder.  This should be transparent to most projects but if you have
<application>BuildAssember</application> configuration files you will need to update the syntax generator IDs in
them.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Switched to a date-based version numbering scheme (YYYY.MM.DD.RR) and updated all tools to use
a common version number.  Changes were also made to the versioning attributes to minimize the need to rebuild
third party components with each new release of the tools.  In future, it should only be necessary to rebuild
third party components if a breaking changes was made requiring an update to the version number used in the
strong name of the dependency assemblies.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Removed the example SandcastleGUI project since it is out of date and serves no real purpose
anymore.  Use the Sandcastle Help File Builder standalone GUI or Visual Studio Package instead if you need a
project management system.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Removed the Examples folder since they were out of date and cannot be built properly from the
installed location.  I will create better standalone build examples and distribute them separately so that they
can be downloaded and built from a usable location at a later date.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated several of the tools to allow running them as MSBuild tasks and removed the PowerShell
scripts.  They were out of date and I know very little about PowerShell so support for them would be problematic.
In any event, since the tools have been updated to run as MSBuild tasks, it makes better sense to standardize on
MSBuild projects rather than PowerShell scripts.</para>

					<content>
						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed a bug in the <application>SegregateByNamespace</application> tool so that it does not
fail for namespaces containing characters that are not legal in a filename.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added conditions to the two document model transformations to favor
<codeInline>AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute</codeInline> if present for the version information.
If not, the existing behavior is used (<codeInline>AssemblyVersionAttribute</codeInline> plus
<codeInline>AssemblyFileVersionAttribute</codeInline> value if present).  It was also marked as a required
attribute in the <application>MRefBuilder</application> configuration files.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added the <application>AddNamespaceGroups</application> tool which adds namespace groups to
the reflection information file.  The grouping information is used to implement the namespace grouping option in
the document model transformations and presentation styles.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Deleted several unused transformations from the production transforms folder.</para>
							</listItem>

						</list>
					</content>

				<section address="MRefBuilder">
					<title>MRefBuilder</title>
					<content>
						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>
								<para>Added a workaround to allow documenting the compiler generated public types in WINMD
assemblies that actually represent user code.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed a couple of bugs in <application>MRefBuilder</application> found while regenerating
the reflection data using the .NETFramework 4.5.1 assemblies and testing it with the .NETCore 4.6 assemblies.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Removed the <codeInline>protectedSealed</codeInline> and <codeInline>noPIA</codeInline>
configuration elements from <localUri>MRefBuilder.config</localUri>.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added the <codeInline>visibility</codeInline> element to <localUri>MRefBuilder.config</localUri>
to control API member visibility in the output.  The options it contains are equivalent to the Sandcastle Help
File Builder options of the same name and are now handled by <application>MRefBuilder</application>.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Deprecated support for the <codeInline>/internal</codeInline>&#160;<codeInline>MRefBuilder</codeInline>
command line option.  The new <codeInline>visibility</codeInline> configuration element provides finer grained
control over member visibility in the output.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added code to output the interop metadata so that the syntax components can add the interop
attributes to the declarations (<codeInline>ComImport</codeInline>, <codeInline>StructLayout</codeInline>,
<codeInline>FieldOffset</codeInline>, <codeInline>PreserveSig</codeInline>, and <codeInline>DllImport</codeInline>).</para>

				<section address="BuildAssembler">
					<title>BuildAssembler and Build Components</title>
					<content>
						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed <codeInline>BrandingComponent</codeInline> so that it applies the language specific
text fix-up on elements in syntax sections which the branding transformations miss for some reason.  This was
only noticeable on members and properties that return a nested type and resulted in multiple separators between
the parts of the qualified type name.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Applied a patch to <codeInline>ResolveReferenceLinksComponent</codeInline> from Stazzz to
write out nested XML elements within the link's inner XML.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Updated <codeInline>IntelliSenseComponent</codeInline> to export code contracts XML
comments elements (<codeInline>requires</codeInline>, <codeInline>ensures</codeInline>,
<codeInline>ensuresOnThrow</codeInline>, <codeInline>pure</codeInline>, <codeInline>invariant</codeInline>,
<codeInline>getter</codeInline>, and <codeInline>setter</codeInline>).</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added code to the syntax components to output the interop attributes to the declarations
based on the metadata (<codeInline>ComImport</codeInline>, <codeInline>StructLayout</codeInline>,
<codeInline>FieldOffset</codeInline>, <codeInline>PreserveSig</codeInline>, and <codeInline>DllImport</codeInline>).</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Deleted <codeInline>ScriptSharpSyntaxGenerator</codeInline>.  The JavaScript syntax
generator has been used in its place for quite some time.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>The <codeInline>SyntaxComponent</codeInline> is now exposed as a configurable component.
It allows you to enable rendering of reference links in the syntax section and to edit the configuration of those
syntax generators that support it such as the Visual Basic and Visual Basic Usage syntax generators.</para>

				<section address="PresentationStyles">
					<title>Presentation Styles</title>
					<content>
						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>
								<para>Added namespace grouping support to the VS2005 and VS2010 presentation styles.  When
enabled, it mimics the nested layout of the namespaces on MSDN that have a common root.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed the tab border and footer background image handling in the VS2010 style so that they
work in all output formats.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed <localUri>branding.js</localUri> in VS2010 so that the proper tab is selected when
switching topics in website output.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Removed <localUri>dev10.mshc</localUri> and extracted the content into the
<localUri>.\branding</localUri> folder.  The configuration files reference it from there now.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Removed the external link icon from all external links in the VS2010 style.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Fixed the incorrect <codeInline>devlang</codeInline> and <codeInline>null</codeInline>
keywords for F# in the VS2010 style.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Removed the <codeInline>label</codeInline> attribute from the <codeInline>language</codeInline>
element passed to the XSL Transform Component in the <codeInline>languages</codeInline> parameter as it is not
needed now.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Merged the Sandcastle Help File Builder shared content into each presentation style so that
they are self-contained.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Moved the stop word lists from the Sandcastle Help File Builder into the
<localUri>Shared\StopWordList</localUri> folder in the presentation style project so that all localizable
resources are kept together in one project.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Simplified the naming of the help file builder shared content files and stop word lists to
be just the language that they represent.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added a boilerplate <codeInline>threadsafety</codeInline> condition to all presentation
styles used when the <codeInline>threadsafety</codeInline> XML comments element is used without any options.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added <codeInline>async</codeInline>, <codeInline>await</codeInline>, <codeInline>let!</codeInline>,
<codeInline>async/await</codeInline>, and <codeInline>async/let!</codeInline> as <codeInline>langword</codeInline>
options on the <codeInline>see</codeInline> XML comments element in the VS2005 and VS2010 styles.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Updated the <application>BuildAssembler</application> configuration files to propagate the
<codeInline>preliminary</codeInline> XML comments element from types to all of their members.  This marks all
members of the type as preliminary without having to add the element to each member's comments.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Added the <codeInline>maxVersionParts</codeInline> transformation argument to the VS2005
and VS2010 presentation styles.  This is used to specify the maximum number of assembly version parts to show in
API member topics.  Set it to 2, 3, or 4 to limit it to 2, 3, or 4 parts or leave it blank for all parts
including the assembly file version value if specified.</para>
