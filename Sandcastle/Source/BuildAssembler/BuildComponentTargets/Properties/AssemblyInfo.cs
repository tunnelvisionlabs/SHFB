// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Revision and Build Numbers by using the '*' as shown
// below:

// NOTE: See description above as to why this assembly is versioned independently of the others.
//
// Revision number should always be zero.  This allows build component and plug-in developers to use the
// same major, minor, and build numbers as the Sandcastle tools to indicate with which version their components
// are compatible.
