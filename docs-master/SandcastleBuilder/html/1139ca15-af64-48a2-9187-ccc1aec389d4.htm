no longer a separate installer for them.  As such, you will need to manually remove the prior release of the
Sandcastle tools.  Leaving them installed will not cause any issues as the new release is located in a different
folder.  However, removing them will avoid any confusion in the future.</td></tr></table></div><p>The majority of the following changes will only affect those that have created custom build
components, syntax generators, plug-ins, and presentation styles.  If you have, carefully read the following
items as you will need to update your components to work with the new Managed Extensibility Framework based
implementation.</p><ul><li>Consolidated the Sandcastle Help File Builder and Sandcastle tools under a single, common
folder structure.  These changes were necessary in order to simplify deployment and support changes to the
component model.</li><li>Since the tools have been consolidated under a single folder, the <span class="code">DXROOT</span>
environment variable is no longer needed.  All tools now use the common <span class="code">SHFBROOT</span>
environment variable instead where needed.</li><li>Removed support for the <span class="code">SHFBCOMPONENTROOT</span>
environment variable as its functionality is handled by the new <span class="code">ComponentPath</span> project
property.</li><li>Updated all build components, syntax generators, plug-ins, and presentation styles so that they
are implemented using the Manged Extensibility Framework (MEF).  A lot of code was moved into a new
<em>Sandcastle.Core</em> library that holds the base classes and MEF implementation classes common to
all of the other projects in the tool set.  This change allows for dynamic discoverability of components at
runtime without the need for special configuration files or file naming conventions.  It also allows for the use
of project-specific components located within a help file project's folder or one that it refers to through the
new <span class="code">ComponentPath</span> property.</li><li>Changed the syntax generator IDs to their actual language names so that they are displayed
using the language name in the help file builder.  This should be transparent to most projects but if you have
<strong>BuildAssember</strong> configuration files you will need to update the syntax generator IDs in
them.</li><li>Switched to a date-based version numbering scheme (YYYY.MM.DD.RR) and updated all tools to use
a common version number.  Changes were also made to the versioning attributes to minimize the need to rebuild
third party components with each new release of the tools.  In future, it should only be necessary to rebuild
third party components if a breaking changes was made requiring an update to the version number used in the
strong name of the dependency assemblies.</li><li>Removed the <span class="code">SandcastlePath</span> project property and all references to it
as it is no longer needed.  It may show up in the <span class="ui">User Defined Properties</span> property page.  If so, it can
be removed from there.</li><li>The help file builder presentation style resource item files have been moved into each
presentation style so that the presentation styles are self-contained.</li><li>The help file builder stop word list files have been moved into the
<em>Shared\StopWordList</em> folder under the presentation style folder so that the localizable
resources are all in one common location.</li><li>Removed the <span class="code">ApplyVisibilityProperties</span> build step as visibility
properties are applied to the reflection information by <strong>MRefBuilder</strong> now. The
<span class="code">ApplyVisibilityProperties()</span> method was modified to take a filename so that plug-ins can
use it to remove members from reflection files generated by other means.</li><li>Moved the <span class="code">TransformReflectionInfo</span> build step to run ahead of the
<span class="code">GenerateNamespaceSummaries</span> build step to allow generation of group topics for use in
the namespace summary editor dialog in a partial build.</li><li>Redefined the partial build in the build engine to allow stopping it after generating
reflection information or after the document model XSL transformation and grouping options have been applied.</li><li><p>The following obsolete and deprecated help file builder build components have been deleted so
that they did not have to updated for use with MEF.  If you still have them in older projects, they will need to
be removed, re-added, and re-configured as needed:</p><ul><li><span class="code">CachedCopyFromIndexComponent</span> - Superseded by the base components
and the ESent/SQL caching components.</li><li><span class="code">CachedResolveReferenceLinksComponent</span> - Superseded by the base
components and the ESent/SQL caching components.</li><li><span class="code">IntelliSenseComponent</span> - Moved to the <strong>BuildAssembler</strong>
components project.</li><li><span class="code">MSHelpAttrComponent</span> - Moved to the <strong>BuildAssembler</strong>
components project.</li><li><span class="code">PostTransformComponent</span> - Code block handling moved to the code
block component and logo support moved to the XSL transformations.</li><li><span class="code">ShowMissingComponent</span> - Moved to the <strong>BuildAssembler</strong>
components project.</li></ul><p>See the prior version release notes for more details.</p></li></ul><a id="OtherChanges"><!----></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">Other Changes Made in This Release</div></div><ul><li>Fixed the project class so that it does not incorrectly try to update the tools version and
mark the project as dirty under Visual Studio 2013.</li><li>Fixed the <span class="code">BuildHelp</span> task and standalone GUI so that all warnings
regardless of format are output to the console when verbose logging is disabled.</li><li>Fixed the framework XML comments file enumerator method so that it ignores folders that exist
but contain no XML comments files.</li><li>Fixed the Sandcastle HTML extract tool so that it finds the <em>HxLink.css</em>
reference regardless of the element's attribute order.</li><li>Fixed the Version Builder plug-in so that it finds the correct XML comments file when the
<span class="code">GenerateProjectSpecificOutputFolder</span> MSBuild option is used.</li><li>Fixed the standalone GUI so that it loads per project user state properly.</li><li>Fixed the build log viewer so that it transforms the log correctly under Visual Studio.</li><li>Added support for installing and removing MS Help Viewer content in Help Viewer 2.1 from the
standalone GUI and VSPackage.  Updated the example scripts to show how to do it as well.</li><li>Updated the standalone GUI to use the evaluated output path value if it contains MSBuild
variables.  This allows it to clean and display the output under such conditions.</li><li>Updated the build engine to run the Sandcastle tools as MSBuild tasks.</li><li>Added support for a <span class="code">ComponentPath</span> project property used to specify the
location of project-specific build components, syntax generators, plug-ins, and presentation styles.  If not
specified, the project's folder alone is used.</li><li>Added support for the "No-PIA embedded interop types" visibility option.</li><li>Exposed the <span class="code">ReferenceOutputAssembly</span> property on project references.
If set to false, the project reference will only be used for MSBuild dependency determination and will not be
used as a reference for <strong>MRefBuilder</strong>.  This allows MSBuild to determine the correct
project build order when building projects in a solution in parallel.</li><li>Added F# to the standard set of syntax filters to match MSDN.  Note that if you have been
using the standard set (C#, VB.NET, C++), you will gain F# by default. Turn it off in the <span class="code">Syntax
Filters</span> property on the <span class="ui">Help File</span> properties page if you do not want it included in the
topics.</li><li>Added namespace grouping support in the form of two new properties located on the <span class="ui">Help
File</span> property page: <span class="code">NamespaceGrouping</span> and <span class="code">MaximumGroupParts</span>.
Note that the selected presentation style must support namespace grouping for these properties to be effective.
Only the VS2005 and VS2010 styles support namespace grouping in this release.</li><li>Updated the <span class="ui">Namespace Summaries</span> dialog to allow editing of namespace group summaries.</li><li>Deprecated the <span class="ui">Hierarchical TOC</span> plug-in as its functionality has been replaced by the
namespace grouping options.  It is still available for presentation styles that do not support MS Help Viewer
output or namespace grouping (Prototype and Hana).</li><li>Removed the <span class="ui">Expand All</span> button from the website index pages as it was not very useful
and could cause a heavy load on the web server.</li><li>Applied changes to the web table of contents style from Sam Harwell.</li><li>Minimized the use of the <span class="code">SHFBROOT</span> environment
variable where possible.  It is still needed in some places to allow for XCOPY deployment of the tools.  It is
possible to run without it defined if you create a <span class="code">SHFBROOT</span> project property that points
to the tools.  See the <a href="50ad2c8c-5004-4b4c-a77f-97b8c403c9f2.htm" target="">XCOPY/Build Server Deployment</a> topic for details.</li><li>Added code the VSPackage to allow using a locally defined <span class="code">SHFBROOT</span>
project variable to set the <span class="code">SHFBROOT</span> environment variable if it does
not exist.  This allows using it without the <span class="code">SHFBROOT</span> environment
variable  defined.</li><li>Added template projects for C# and VB.NET in the <span class="ui">Documentation</span> subcategory used to
create plug-ins, build components, syntax generators, and presentation style components.  The template code
contains the necessary MEF attribute and/or factory class to produce a valid component.</li></ul><a name="seeAlsoSection"><!----></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">See Also</div></div><h4 class="subHeading">Other Resources</h4><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><a href="078cc1c7-7995-431e-bf9c-8813becbe8df.htm" target="">Version History</a></div></div></div></div></div><div id="OH_footer" class="OH_footer"><p><a href="http://SHFB.CodePlex.com" target="_blank">[v2014.2.15.0] Copyright © 2006-2014, Eric Woodruff, All rights reserved (http://SHFB.CodePlex.com)</a></p><div class="OH_feedbacklink"><a href="mailto:Eric@EWoodruff.us?subject=Sandcastle+Help+File+Builder+Documentation+Version+2014.1.26.0+Beta+100+EN-US&amp;body=Your%20feedback%20is%20used%20to%20improve%20the%20documentation%20and%20the%20product.%20Your%20e-mail%20address%20will%20not%20be%20used%20for%20any%20other%20purpose%20and%20is%20disposed%20of%20after%20the%20issue%20you%20report%20is%20resolved.%20While%20working%20to%20resolve%20the%20issue%20that%20you%20report%2c%20you%20may%20be%20contacted%20via%20e-mail%20to%20get%20further%20details%20or%20clarification%20on%20the%20feedback%20you%20sent.%20After%20the%20issue%20you%20report%20has%20been%20addressed%2c%20you%20may%20receive%20an%20e-mail%20to%20let%20you%20know%20that%20your%20feedback%20has%20been%20addressed.">Send Feedback</a> on this topic to Eric Woodruff.</div></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function () {DocumentReady();});</script></body></html>
