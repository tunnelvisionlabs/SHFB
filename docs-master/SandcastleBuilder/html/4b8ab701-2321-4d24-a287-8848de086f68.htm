<span class="code">link</span> MAML element. Changes can be made to the topic properties such as the filename
associated with the ID and its title text without having to visit each topic in which it is referenced.  When
creating new topics using the help file builder, templates are used and new ID and revision numbers are assigned
automatically.  The content layout editor tracks topics by ID rather than by filename.  As such, you can
rearrange and rename the files in the project without being concerned about updating references to them in the
content layout files.  As long as the ID remains the same, the same topic will be associated with the entry
regardless of where it is moved or what it is named.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img src="../icons/AlertNote.png" alt="Note"> Note</th></tr><tr><td><p>The value of the ID assigned to a topic should not be changed.  If it is, you will be required to
manually locate and update the old ID in all topics that reference it.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Within the content layout editor, each topic contains several properties which are described below.</p><dl><dt>ID, Revision #, and Topic Filename</dt><dd><p>These read-only properties display the ID and revision number of the topic and the project file
related to the ID.  The three buttons to the right of the currently associated topic filename let you do the
following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Associate Topic</strong> - The layout file tracks topics by their unique ID
rather than by filename.  This button allows you to associate a different topic file with a content layout file
entry or add an association to an empty container node.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clear Topic Association</strong> - This button allows you to clear the topic
file associated with a content layout file entry converting it into an empty container node.  The node will not
have a topic associated with it in the compiled help file nor will it display a topic when selected in the table
of contents.  It simply serves as a container for other topics and must have at least one child topic defined for
it.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img src="../icons/AlertNote.png" alt="Note"> Note</th></tr><tr><td><p>The MS Help Viewer file format does not support empty container nodes.  All entries must have
an associated topic.  If one is not specified, an empty topic will be generated at build time so that a valid
help file is produced.</p></td></tr></table></div></li><li><p><strong>Refresh Associations</strong> - If you move one or more files around or rename
them in the Project Explorer, the currently open content layout file editor will not be aware of these changes.
Use this button after making such changes so that the content layout editor refreshes the files associated with
each topic.  This allows you to open them for editing from the layout editor after moving or renaming them
without closing and reopening the layout editor.  This option refreshes the entire collection of topics, not just
the one currently being viewed.</p></li></ul></dd><dt>Title</dt><dd><p>This is used as the title for the topic.  In addition, it will be used as the table of contents
title unless a <strong>TOC Title</strong> value is specified.  It will also be used as the link text
unless a <strong>Link Text</strong> value is specified.  If left blank, the topic filename is used as
a default title.</p></dd><dt>TOC Title</dt><dd><p>This is used to specify an optional table of contents title for a topic.  If not set, the
<strong>Title</strong> value will be used. In some cases, the title may not be appropriate for the table
of contents or is too long to be practical. In such cases you can specify shorter or more appropriate text for
the table of contents via this property.</p></dd><dt>Link Text</dt><dd><p>This property can be used to specify an alternate value to use as the inner text for links.  If not
set, the <strong>Title</strong> value will be used.  In some cases the title may not be appropriate or
may be too long to be practical for links that refer to the topic.  In such cases you can specify shorter or more
appropriate text for the link via this property.  This saves you from having to specify the shorter inner text on
each link that uses the topic ID.</p></dd><dt>Show in the table of contents</dt><dd><p>This allows you to specify whether or not a topic will appear in the table of contents.  The default
is checked to show it.  If unchecked, the topic will be included in the help file but will only be accessible via
links from other topics.  This is a convenient way of adding content to the help file but limiting the amount of
information displayed in the table of contents.  A hollow bullet point appears next to invisible topics in the
content layout tree to note their status.  Making a parent topic invisible will also remove its child topics
from the table of contents.</p></dd><dt>Use as the default topic</dt><dd><p>This will mark the selected topic as the default topic for the help file.  The default topic option
acts as a toggle.  Check it on a topic to set it as the default.  If another topic was previously marked as the
default topic, the option is removed from it.  Unchecking it on the same topic turns it off and no topic will be
selected as the default topic.  In such cases, the root namespaces page will be the default topic for the help
file.  When set, a green circle icon with a checkmark appears next to the topic in the content layout tree to
indicate its status.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img src="../icons/AlertNote.png" alt="Note"> Note</th></tr><tr><td><p>This option only has an effect on Help 1, Help 2, and Website output.  MS Help Viewer does not

including MS Help Viewer output.  By default, all topics in the MS Help Viewer output are listed as root elements
in their parent topic.  If you would prefer them to be grouped under a common root container topic, add a topic
to the content layout file and use this option to mark it as the root container.  The root container must have
its <strong>Show in the table of contents</strong> option unchecked so that it is not included in the
table of contents.  This prevents it from appearing in the other help file formats.  It will be added
automatically to the MS Help Viewer output when that format is built.  If you want a root container to appear in
all formats, simply add it as a normal topic in the content layout file and manually add all of the other topics
to it as sub-topics.  This option acts as a toggle.  Check it on a topic to set it as the container.  If another
topic was previously marked as the container topic, the option is removed from it.  For more information, see the
<a href="ba42b2c2-985d-46f1-ba4c-3d921edcafe3.htm">Content Placement Options</a> topic.  When set, a file tree icon appears next to the
topic in the content layout tree to indicate its status.</p></dd><dt>API Content</dt><dd><p>This is used to indicate how the API (reference) content for the help file should be inserted
relative to the selected topic.  The following options are available:</p><ul><li><p><strong>None</strong> - This topic will not be used as the API content insertion point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Insert after this topic</strong> - The API content will be inserted immediately
after this topic in the table of contents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Insert before this topic</strong> - The API content will be inserted immediately
before this topic in the table of contents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Insert as child of this topic</strong> - The API content topics are added as
sub-topics of the selected topic.  If the selected topic already contains sub-topics, the API topics will appear
after them.</p></li></ul><p>This option acts as a toggle.  Select a value other than <strong>None</strong> to make it the
API content insertion point.  If another topic was previously marked as the API content insertion point, the
option is removed from it.  An icon will appear next to the topic in the content layout tree to indicate its
API content insertion point state.  This option can be combined with the default topic option.  If no topic is
set as the API content insertion point, the API content will be added to the table of contents following the
standard <a href="ba42b2c2-985d-46f1-ba4c-3d921edcafe3.htm">content placement rules</a>.</p></dd><dt>Index Keywords</dt><dd><p>This grid allows you to add <span class="code">MSHelp:Keyword</span> attributes to the help topic
to define its index keywords.  In the grid for this property, select the index and enter the terms for it.
Keyword terms can contain <a href="69d998a7-1af5-4bf5-889b-59cd00b64000.htm">substitution tags</a> which

term in the help file's index.  If your intent is to add two terms to the same index but have them appear as two
distinct entries, enter them on two separate rows in the grid.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img src="../icons/AlertNote.png" alt="Tip"> Tip</th></tr><tr><td><p>If a topic is marked as the default using the designer, entries for the
