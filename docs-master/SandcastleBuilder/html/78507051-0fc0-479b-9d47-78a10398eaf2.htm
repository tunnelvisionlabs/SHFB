such as creating projects, adding and removing files to them, and building them.  There are many additional
benefits to using Visual Studio for help file builder projects such as:</p><ul><li>Help file projects are part of a Visual Studio solution file and can be combined and built
along with other project types such as the assembly projects that they are documenting.  As such, there is no
longer a need to build the help file project using the post-build event of another project.  You can also
combine multiple help file projects into a single solution file.</li><li>The <span class="ui">Solution Explorer</span> tool window supports multiple selection and you can perform
operations on more than one file at once.</li><li>With the projects hosted in Visual Studio, you gain access to source control and can
manage help file builder projects under source control much more easily.</li><li><p>Visual Studio provides better editors for all of the common file types.  In addition, you gain
access to extra features when editing files such as IntelliSense.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="mtps-img-src" src="./../icons/alert_note.gif" alt="Tip"> <strong>Tip</strong></th></tr><tr><td>The help file builder guided installer offers an option to enable IntelliSense for MAML
topics within Visual Studio.  It is highly recommended that you let it install the necessary schemas to enable
this option.</td></tr></table></div></li><li>Additional add-ins and extensions can be installed to provide new features such as
spell checking, etc.</li></ul><p>The equivalent project management features and commands from the standalone GUI should be quite easy
to find within Visual Studio.  Opening existing projects, managing files within a project, building a project, and
cleaning the project output, is done the same way as for any other type of Visual Studio project.  The <span class="ui">Solution
Explorer</span> tool window in Visual Studio corresponds to the <span class="ui">Project Explorer</span> tool window in the standalone
GUI and provides all of the same options with regard to adding and removing documentation sources, references, and
other supporting files.  Properties for project items are edited via the <span class="ui">Properties</span> tool window in Visual
Studio.  An additional <span class="ui">Project Properties</span> node appears in the Visual Studio solution explorer that lets you
open the project property editor window.  You can also get to it by right clicking on the project node and selecting
the <span class="ui">Properties</span> context menu option.  The <span class="ui">Open Project in Standalone GUI</span> option on the project node's
context menu will allow you to open the selected project in the standalone GUI.  The <span class="ui">View Build Log Content</span>
option on the context menu will allow you to open the <span class="ui">Build Log Content</span> tool window.  It displays the full
content of the build log from the last time the help file project was built.</p><a id="ProjectProps"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">Editing a Project's Properties</div></div><p>The project properties can be accessed by selecting the <span class="ui">Properties</span> context menu option on the
project node or by double-clicking the <span class="ui">Project Properties</span> node in the <span class="ui">Solution Explorer</span> tool
window.  The project properties editor window in Visual Studio is almost identical to the one in the standalone
GUI.  Properties are grouped into categories sorted by frequency of usage rather than alphabetically.  On each
property page, an information and/or warning tip icon appears after some properties.  Hover the mouse over the
icon to see additional usage notes or warnings related to the property.</p><div class="ps_mediaCenter"><img alt="Visual Studio project properties editor" src="./../media/VSProjectPropsEditor.png"></div><a id="SHFBToolbar"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">Menu Option and Toolbar Locations</div></div><p>A toolbar is available for help file builder projects.  On it, you will find the options to open the
various help file formats, open the MS Help Viewer library manager tool, open the build log content tool window,
open the FAQ help topic, and open the help file builder's help file.  The help file viewing options are also
available from the <span class="ui">View</span> | <span class="ui">View Help File</span> submenu.  To show or hide the help file builder toolbar,
either select the <span class="ui">View</span> | <span class="ui">Toolbars</span> | <span class="ui">Sandcastle Help File Builder</span> menu option or right
click in the toolbar area and select the <span class="ui">Sandcastle Help File Builder</span> context menu option.</p><p>The <span class="ui">Entity References</span> tool window and <span class="ui">Topic Previewer</span> window can be opened by
selecting their menu option on the <span class="ui">View</span> | <span class="ui">Other Windows</span> menu or from the <span class="ui">Other Windows</span>
toolbar button dropdown.  The build log tool window can be opened by selecting <span class="ui">Build</span> | <span class="ui">View Build

<span class="ui">Environment</span> category, and select the <span class="ui">Keyboard</span> sub-category.  From there, you can enter
part of the name of a help file builder option (i.e. <em>entityref</em>) to find
matching commands, select them in the list of matches, and assign new shortcuts keys to them as you see
fit.</td></tr></table></div><a id="SourceControl"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">Source Control Tips</div></div><p>As noted above, using Visual Studio to manage help file builder projects provides access to the built-in
source control providers within it.  When making changes to a project or file within Visual Studio, source control
operations will occur as they normally do for any other project type.  If you edit a help file builder project or
its related files with both Visual Studio and the standalone GUI keep the following in mind:</p><ul><li>Files can be added and removed from the project while it is open in both Visual Studio and
the standalone GUI.  Both will prompt you to reload the project if they detect that it has been modified outside
of their respective environment.</li><li>The standalone GUI does not support source control.  As such, you must check the files out in
Visual Studio prior to saving any changes made to them in the standalone GUI.  It is best to check files out prior
to modifying them in the standalone GUI so that you can ensure that you have a current version of the file if
necessary.</li><li>If you need to rename a file, it is recommended that you do it from within Visual Studio
rather than the standalone GUI so that the source control provider makes a note of the rename operation.  Such
changes made to a source controlled file in the standalone GUI may cause problems with keeping the file in synch
with the source control store.</li><li><p>Files can be safely added to a source controlled project from the standalone GUI.  However, when
you load the project or refresh it in Visual Studio, the new files will not automatically be added to source
control.  To remedy this situation, do the following from within Visual Studio:</p><ol><li>Make sure the project node or one of its files is selected and use the
<span class="ui">Project</span> | <span class="ui">Show All Files</span> option to show all files within the project folder including those
that are not part of the project.</li><li>Select each of the files that was added via the standalone GUI.</li><li>Right click on one of the selected files and select the <span class="ui">Exclude From Project</span>
context menu option.  This will exclude the files from the project.  Because the Show All Files option is enabled,
they will still appear as items in the solution explorer but with an icon that indicates their excluded state.</li><li>With the same set of files selected, right click on one of them again and select the
<span class="ui">Include In Project</span> context menu option.  The files will be added to the project again and the source
control provider will automatically add them to the source control store.  Once done, the icons next to the files
will change to show that they are once again part of the project and that they have been added to source control.
Note that you may need to adjust the file's properties after adding them back to the project (i.e. files that
have an <span class="ui">Image</span> build action).</li></ol></li></ul><a name="seeAlsoSection"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">See Also</div></div><h4 class="subHeading">Other Resources</h4><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><a href="b128ad2a-787e-48c7-b946-f6953080c386.htm" target="">Visual Studio Integration Package</a></div><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><a href="f68822d2-97ba-48da-a98b-46747983b4a0.htm" target="">Project File Converters</a></div></div></div></div></div><div id="OH_footer" class="OH_footer"><p><a href="http://SHFB.CodePlex.com" target="_blank">[v2014.2.15.0] Copyright © 2006-2014, Eric Woodruff, All rights reserved (http://SHFB.CodePlex.com)</a></p><div class="OH_feedbacklink"><a href="mailto:Eric@EWoodruff.us?subject=Sandcastle+Help+File+Builder+Documentation+Feature+Comparison+and+Location+100+EN-US&amp;body=Your%20feedback%20is%20used%20to%20improve%20the%20documentation%20and%20the%20product.%20Your%20e-mail%20address%20will%20not%20be%20used%20for%20any%20other%20purpose%20and%20is%20disposed%20of%20after%20the%20issue%20you%20report%20is%20resolved.%20While%20working%20to%20resolve%20the%20issue%20that%20you%20report%2c%20you%20may%20be%20contacted%20via%20e-mail%20to%20get%20further%20details%20or%20clarification%20on%20the%20feedback%20you%20sent.%20After%20the%20issue%20you%20report%20has%20been%20addressed%2c%20you%20may%20receive%20an%20e-mail%20to%20let%20you%20know%20that%20your%20feedback%20has%20been%20addressed.">Send Feedback</a> on this topic to Eric Woodruff.</div></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function () {DocumentReady();});</script></body></html>
