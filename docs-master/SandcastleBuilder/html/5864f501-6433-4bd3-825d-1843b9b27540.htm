project options as the old file format.  The main difference that you will notice is that additional content and
conceptual content files are now exposed and managed via the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>.  This
makes it much easier to manage the files and add new ones.  The following are the main differences and some
issues that you may encounter with the converted project file:</p><ul><li>Review all path related properties to ensure that they are still accurate in the new project.</li><li><p>Review the <strong>Documentation Sources</strong> and <strong>References</strong>
project nodes to see that the required items were imported correctly and make any necessary adjustments.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="mtps-img-src" src="./../icons/alert_note.gif" alt="Tip"> <strong>Tip</strong></th></tr><tr><td>
	  Given that solutions and projects are supported as
documentation sources, you may find it easier to add them as documentation
sources instead of the assemblies, comments, and references that they contain.
When a solution or project is used, these items are imported from them
automatically at build time.</td></tr></table></div></li><li>Review the configurations for all build components added via the
<span class="code">ComponentConfigurations</span> property and the configurations for all plug-ins added via the
<span class="code">PlugInConfigurations</span> property.  It may be necessary to adjust the paths on file-related
options.</li><li>Not all files can be detected and added to the project (i.e. files referenced in topics such as
example code files, the logo file in the Post-Transform component, etc.).  If build errors result from missing
files, simply add them to the project or adjust the paths and/or filenames as needed.</li><li>If you were using the Code Block Component, you may need to adjust the path to external source
files in the source attribute on the <span class="code">&lt;code&gt;</span> elements.</li><li>Conceptual content media files are added as project file items.  Their
<span class="code">BuildAction</span> is set to <span class="code">Image</span> and the additional properties such
as the ID and alternate text are stored in the file item properties.</li><li>Conceptual content tokens are stored in a file that is added to the project and its
<span class="code">BuildAction</span> is set to <span class="code">Tokens</span> to indicate that it should be
treated as such in the build.  The extension on the filename is set to <em>.tokens</em>.</li><li>If a conceptual content code snippets files is defined, it is added to the project and its
<span class="code">BuildAction</span> is set to <span class="code">CodeSnippets</span> to indicate that it should
be treated as such in the build.  The extension on the filename is changed to <em>.snippets</em>.</li><li><p>All additional content files and subfolders are added to the project recursively as file items
with default build actions based on the file extensions.  If it does not already contain one, you can add a site
map to the project and edit it to set the order and layout of the additional content items.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="mtps-img-src" src="./../icons/alert_note.gif" alt="Tip"> <strong>Tip</strong></th></tr><tr><td>The help file builder contains full support for conceptual content that uses Microsoft
Assistance Markup Language (MAML) to create additional non-API topics such as How-Tos, walkthroughs, etc.  You
may want to consider switching any additional HTML content to conceptual content to take advantage of its
features.  See the <a href="3d4edd2d-7883-4508-b9d2-bd7b4d848b0d.htm" target="">Conceptual Content</a> topic for more information.</td></tr></table></div></li><li>Wildcard additional content items are expanded into individual file entries in the new project.
As such, you may find that unwanted files have been added to the project (i.e. source control files) that you
were not aware of before as they were copied as part of build and may not have been noticed.  The extra files can
be deleted from the new project.</li><li>Because the additional content files actually become part of the project and are copied to the
project folder, their base path may be different than the destination path specified in the old project.  The
file's location within the project is used to determine its destination path in the compiled help file.  Files at
the root end up in the root folder of the compiled help file.  Files in subfolders end up in like-named
subfolders in the compiled help file.  These paths may differ from the old project and you may need to adjust the
file locations within the project after conversion to get them where they need to be when the project is built.</li><li>Conceptual content topics are copied to the project and will have their filename extension
changed from <em>.xml</em> to <em>.aml</em> to reflect their actual purpose.  Note that
the <span class="code">BuildAction</span> on topics files is set to <span class="code">None</span>.  This is
correct as the <span class="term">content layout file</span> determines which topics are included in the help file at
build time.</li><li>In addition to the filename extension change, the topic ID and revision number are embedded in
each converted MAML topic file.  Going forward, all conceptual topic files must contain a root
<span class="code">&lt;topic&gt;</span> element with <span class="code">id</span> and
<span class="code">revisionNumber</span> attributes.  This is done to allow the content layout file to reference
topics by ID alone and lets topic files move around without you having to update their physical location in the
layout files.</li><li>Any HTML or <em>.topic</em> files found in the conceptual content layout will be
modified to include <span class="code">&lt;meta&gt;</span> elements that contain the ID and revision number for
the same reason the ID and revision number are added to the conceptual content MAML topic files.</li></ul><a name="seeAlsoSection"><!----></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">See Also</div></div><h4 class="subHeading">Other Resources</h4><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><a href="f68822d2-97ba-48da-a98b-46747983b4a0.htm" target="">Project File Converters</a></div><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><a href="8e3f8757-0ef3-4772-bb2f-5d7ae57e50da.htm" target="">Sandcastle Help File Builder Overview</a></div><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><a href="5a484e94-6940-4c97-940c-3f46fb8736d2.htm" target="">Version 1.8.0.0 (Alpha)</a></div></div></div></div></div><div id="OH_footer" class="OH_footer"><p><a href="http://SHFB.CodePlex.com" target="_blank">[v2014.2.15.0] Copyright © 2006-2014, Eric Woodruff, All rights reserved (http://SHFB.CodePlex.com)</a></p><div class="OH_feedbacklink"><a href="mailto:Eric@EWoodruff.us?subject=Sandcastle+Help+File+Builder+Documentation+SHFB+v1.7.0.0+or+Earlier+Converter+100+EN-US&amp;body=Your%20feedback%20is%20used%20to%20improve%20the%20documentation%20and%20the%20product.%20Your%20e-mail%20address%20will%20not%20be%20used%20for%20any%20other%20purpose%20and%20is%20disposed%20of%20after%20the%20issue%20you%20report%20is%20resolved.%20While%20working%20to%20resolve%20the%20issue%20that%20you%20report%2c%20you%20may%20be%20contacted%20via%20e-mail%20to%20get%20further%20details%20or%20clarification%20on%20the%20feedback%20you%20sent.%20After%20the%20issue%20you%20report%20has%20been%20addressed%2c%20you%20may%20receive%20an%20e-mail%20to%20let%20you%20know%20that%20your%20feedback%20has%20been%20addressed.">Send Feedback</a> on this topic to Eric Woodruff.</div></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function () {DocumentReady();});</script></body></html>
