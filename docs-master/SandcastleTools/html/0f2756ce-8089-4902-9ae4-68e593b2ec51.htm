This release was issued before officially being

changes from the Sandcastle Styles patch into the Sandcastle XSL transformations.</p><ul class="autoOutline"><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#GeneralChanges" target="">General Changes</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#Schemas" target="">Schemas</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#CommandLineLibrary" target="">Command Line Library</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#MRefBuilder" target="">MRefBuilder Tool</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#BuildAssembler" target="">BuildAssember Tools</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#BuildComponents" target="">Build Components</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#DBCSFix" target="">DBCSFix Tool</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#ChmBuilder" target="">ChmBuilder Tools</a></li><li class="outlineSectionEntry"><a href="#PresentationStyles" target="">Presentation Styles</a></li></ul></div><a id="GeneralChanges"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">General Changes</div></div><ul><li>Rearranged the source project folders to match the installed folder layout.  This makes testing
a development build much easier as you can point <span class="code">DXROOT</span> at the
<em>.\Sandcastle\Main</em> folder and have it work like a release build.</li><li>Created separate solutions for each tool so that they can be loaded, built, and tested
individually.  Reflector was used to get the source code for the tools that were missing source code and projects
were added for them too.</li><li>All tools are now built using .NET 4.0.  This will allow taking advantage of newer features in
the runtime added since .NET 2.0.  This does not change the ability to run the tools against assemblies built
with prior framework versions.  That is still supported.</li><li>Removed all <em>GlobalSuppressions.cs</em> files from all projects.  Many of us
do not have a version of Visual Studio that supports code analysis within the IDE.  Instead, individual FxCop
projects have been created for each project.  Some clean up has been performed based on the initial scans.
Warnings still exist in several projects and have been left for review until later.</li><li>Signed all assemblies with a new key file and standardized the assembly attributes.</li><li>Added <em>Data\BuildReflectionData.bat</em> and
<em>Data\BuildReflectionData.proj</em> to properly rebuild the reflection data files.</li><li>Updated the XSL style sheet version number to 2.0 in all XSL transformations. A bug in .NET 4.0
prevents the <span class="code">&lt;xsl:sort&gt;</span> function from working when using XSL version 1.1.</li><li>Merged the Sandcastle Guided Installer, the Language Pack, Sandcastle MAML Guide, Web Code
Providers, and the HTML to MAML Converter projects from Sandcastle Styles into the Sandcastle project.  These are
located under the <em>.\Extras</em> folder.</li><li>The Sandcastle Guided Installer has been rewritten as a WPF application.  It uses flow
documents rather than HTML resources for the pages which are much easier to extend and work with in the code.</li><li>Created a new setup project to install Sandcastle.  This version includes the content from the
<em>.\Extras</em> folder as additional installable options.  This installer also gives Sandcastle a
presence on the Program Files menu with links to the included help files, the project web site, and the example
GUI.  The setup project is located in the <em>.\Extras folder</em> too as it isn't part of the core
Sandcastle code and uses the WiX tools.</li></ul><a id="Schemas"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">Schemas</div></div><ul><li>Added a new <span class="code">optional</span> attribute to the reflection data schema for
parameter elements.  This is needed to properly document optional parameters that use
<span class="code">OptionalAttribute</span> and have no default specified using assignment.</li><li>Updated the MAML schemas to include all of the new elements and attributes added by the
Sandcastle Styles patch and adjusted a few elements to reflect how Sandcastle uses them.  This allows for proper
validation of MAML topics in Visual Studio.</li></ul><a id="CommandLineLibrary"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">Command Line Library</div></div><ul><li>Reworked the command line option classes to fix various FxCop warnings and to correctly
implement support for required options.</li></ul><a id="MRefBuilder"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">MRefBuilder Tool</div></div><ul><li>Moved the content of the <em>CCI\</em> and <em>Reflection\</em> folders
into the MRefBuilder project and made them members of the project so that they are compiled directly into
<em>MRefBuilder.exe</em> to match prior releases of Sandcastle.</li><li>Fixed <em>ExtensionMethodAddIn.cs</em> so that it doesn't add extension methods to
enumerations and static classes (Sandcastle work item #8852).</li><li>Fixed <em>ExtensionMethodAddIn.cs</em> so that it ignores unexposed namespaces and
types.  This prevents it from scanning unnecessary namespaces and types and stops a crash caused by it scanning
compiler generated types created by the code contracts post-processing tool (Sandcastle work item #11066).</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">Method.ImplicitlyImplementedInterfaceMethods</span> in
<em>Nodes.cs</em> so that it recognizes interface member matches when the return type is generic
(Sandcastle work item #22970).</li><li>Fixed <em>GetTemplateMember()</em> and <em>ParametersMatch()</em> to
properly check for template parameters when there are method overloads in which one uses a generic type and the
other does not (i.e. <span class="code">Contains(T)</span> and <span class="code">Contains(Guid)</span>).
This was Sandcastle work item #1908 and most likely fixed work item #7803 too as it looks similar and the test
case works as expected now.</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">TypeNode.Attributes</span> so that it will not get stuck in an endless
loop if a type's attribute references the type being parsed (Sandcastle work item #2253).</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">TypeNode.NestedTypes</span> so that it will not get stuck in an endless
loop when a type contains a nested type that itself implements a nested type from within the containing type.</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">IsExposedMember()</span> and <span class="code">IsExposedType()</span>
in <em>ApiFilter.cs</em> so that they ignore unrecognized type and member visibility values
(Sandcastle work item #2967 and #2969).</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">IsExposedMember()</span> so that it compares generic members using the
<span class="code">Name&lt;T&gt;</span> and <span class="code">Name{T}</span> syntax so that it gets a match either
way (Sandcastle work item #5593).</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">IsExposedExpression()</span> in <em>ApiFilter.cs</em> so
that it doesn't exclude a type in an attribute expression as long as the hidden type has exposed members thus
exposing the type.</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">IsExposedNamespace()</span>, <span class="code">IsExposedType()</span>,
and <span class="code">IsExposedMember()</span> in <em>ApFilter.cs</em> so that they exclude members
with names containing characters that are not valid in XML (i.e. obfuscated member names).</li><li>Fixed <em>MemberDictionary.Contains()</em> so that when checking for matching
members it compares generic template parameters by name to match members with generic parameters correctly.  This
fixes an issue where it treats overridden members as overloads when they contain generic template parameters.
This was Sandcastle work item #4553 and most likely fixed work item #11303 too as it looks similar and the test
case works as expected now.</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">OrcasNamer.WriteTemplate()</span> so that it uses the correct template
parameter names which do not always match the base class's template parameter names (i.e.
<span class="code">Collection&lt;TControl&gt;</span> vs. <span class="code">Collection&lt;T&gt;</span>).
Sandcastle work item #5594.</li><li>I am not sure if one of the other changes fixed it or if it was fixed already in the source
code, but Sandcastle work item #2903 (Spurious references to parameterized class with inner class) is fixed as
the test cases in it work as expected.</li><li>Added a check for exposed members in unexposed types in <span class="code">IsExposedType()</span>
in <em>ApiFilter.cs</em>.  Such cases effectively expose the type and it should be included whenever
this check occurs for it.  Without the check, it was incorrectly excluding types in several locations.</li><li>Added <span class="code">CompilerGeneratedAttribute</span> check to <span class="code">IsExposedType()</span>
in <em>ExternalDocumentedFilter.cs</em> as public members can sometimes be compiler generated (i.e.
generated types for public fields that use the <span class="code">fixed</span> keyword).  This was a new issue I
found while testing the <span class="code">fixed</span> keyword syntax issue.</li><li>Added <span class="code">FixedBufferAttribute</span> to the default <em>MRefBuilder.config</em>
API filter as an exposed attribute so that it gets passed through.  This is needed in order to properly document
fixed members in the syntax section.</li><li>Added <span class="code">OptionalAttribute</span> to the default <em>MRefBuilder.config</em>
API filter as an exposed attribute so that it gets passed through.  This is needed in order to properly document
optional parameters.</li><li>Added code to write out the new <span class="code">optional</span> attribute for optional
parameters.  This is needed to properly document optional parameters that use <span class="code">OptionalAttribute</span>
and have no default specified using assignment.  The syntax components and XSL transformations have been updated
to make use of it to document optional parameters and their values (Sandcastle work item #9627).</li><li>Merged my changes into the <span class="code">AssemblyResolver</span> class to provide support
for assembly binding redirection.  Added example configuration info for it to <em>MRefBuilder.config</em>
(Sandcastle work item #1014).</li></ul><a id="BuildAssembler"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">BuildAssember Tools</div></div><ul><li>Added the proxy configuration settings that work around the HTTP 407 and HTTP 417 errors in
comments to the <em>BuildAssembler.exe.config</em> file.</li><li>Added support for specifying a verbosity level on the configuration element.  This can
significantly reduce the build assembler output and makes it easier to see warnings as it is much less chatty.
The default verbosity is <span class="code">Info</span> so that its default behavior matches prior releases.</li></ul><a id="BuildComponents"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">Build Components</div></div><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="mtps-img-src" src="./../icons/alert_caution.gif" alt="Important note"> <strong>Important</strong></th></tr><tr><td>Custom build components that override <span class="code">Dispose()</span> will need to be updated
to override <span class="code">protected void Dispose(bool disposing)</span> rather than <span class="code">public void
Dispose()</span> as the Sandcastle source code release correctly implements the <span class="code">IDisposable</span>
pattern.</td></tr></table></div><ul><li>Fixed <span class="code">ResolveReferenceLinksComponent2</span> so that it does not write out
unnecessary parentheses on unresolved property elements (Sandcastle work item #1987).</li><li>Fixed <span class="code">ResolveReferenceLinksComponent2</span> so that references to enumerated
field types are redirected to the containing enumerated type so as to produce a valid link target (Sandcastle
work item #2221).</li><li>Fixed the C#, C++, VB.NET, F#, and J# syntax generator components so that they output numeric
attribute values.  In the event that an unrecognized attribute parameter type is encountered, the syntax
generators write out the value as-is.  Array parameters are also supported now but the reflection data does not
contain the values.  As such, it writes out the array type and a generic "{ ... }" placeholder where the values
would go.  The information is probably there but it would probably require changes to the CCI code to include it
(Sandcastle work item #6779)</li><li>Fixed the <span class="code">XamlUsageSyntaxGenerator.WritePropertySyntax()</span> so that it
generates syntax for properties with abstract return types as long as there is a type converter for it (i.e.
<span class="code">Brush</span>)  Sandcastle work item #5466.</li><li>Added support for a <span class="code">duplicateWarnings</span> attribute that can be added to
the data elements of the index element on the <span class="code">CopyFromIndexComponent</span>.  When set to
false, it suppresses duplicate index key warnings.  This is useful for comments files where there can be
duplicate keys but it isn't an issue.  The default is true if not specified to maintain the behavior from past
releases and report the warnings (Sandcastle work item #11844).</li><li>Added support for optional arguments to the C#, C++, VB.NET, F#, and J# syntax generator
components. I did not enclose them in brackets as it looked rather odd when attributes were present and the
assignment is a dead giveaway that it is an optional parameter.  As such, it uses the standard syntax but I did
update the XSL transformations to include "(Optional") after the parameter name in the Parameters section of the
topic (Sandcastle work item #9627).</li><li>Added support for attributes on property getter/setter methods to the C#, C++, VB.NET, F#, and
J# syntax generator components (Sandcastle work item #973).</li><li>Made the unsafe code checks consistent across all syntax generators and added a check for the
<span class="code">FixedBufferAttribute</span> to the <span class="code">apiIsUnsafeExpression</span> XPath
expression.</li><li>Added <span class="code">fixed</span> keyword support to the C# and C++ syntax generators
(Sandcastle work item #10107).</li><li>Added <span class="code">interior_ptr&lt;&gt;</span> support to the C++ syntax generator.  Added
a fix-up regular expression to the Sandcastle help file builder too so that the comments are included in the
member page (Sandcastle work item #2299).</li><li><p>Merged my changes and bug fixes into the <span class="code">MSHCComponent</span>.  The changes
include:</p><ul><li>Support for a <span class="code">sortOrder</span> option on the TOC elements to allow the
sort order of the elements to be defined to set the proper placement of the TOC entries when parented to an entry
outside of the help file and to parent the API content within a conceptual content folder.</li><li>Fixed a bug that caused a "duplicate key" error under certain conditions.</li><li>Fixed an incorrect XPath expression that was letting duplicate metadata through.</li></ul></li><li>Added my <span class="code">JavaScriptDeclarationSyntaxGenerator</span> to the
<span class="code">SyntaxComponents</span> assembly.  Modified <em>FixScriptSharp.xsl</em> to include
a <span class="code">scriptSharp</span> element to indicate to the syntax generator that it should apply the
casing rules to member names.  This allows the added syntax generator to work with normal JavaScript and
Script# projects alike (Sandcastle work item #1999).</li><li><p>Merged my changes and bug fixes into the ResolveConceptualLinksComponent (Sandcastle work item
#2193):</p><ul><li>Broken links use the <span class="code">None</span> style rather than the <span class="code">Index</span>
style so that it is apparent that they do not work.</li><li>The inner text from the conceptual link is used if specified.</li><li>On broken links, when the <span class="code">showBrokenLinkText</span> option is true and
there is no inner text, the target value is displayed.</li><li>Conceptual link targets can include an optional anchor name from within the target such as
"#Name".</li><li>Unnecessary whitespace is removed from the link text.</li><li>If the companion file contains a <span class="code">&lt;linkText&gt;</span> element and no
inner text is specified, its value will be used for the link text rather than the title.  This allows for a
shorter title or description to use as the default link text.</li></ul></li></ul><a id="DBCSFix"></a><div class="OH_CollapsibleAreaRegion"><div class="OH_regiontitle">DBCSFix Tool</div></div><ul><li>Updated the file masks to use <em>*.htm?</em> to find both <em>.htm</em>
