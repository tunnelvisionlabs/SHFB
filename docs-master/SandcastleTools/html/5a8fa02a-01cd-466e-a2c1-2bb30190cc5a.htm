XSL transformations that are executed in a specific sequence to produce a set of files that can be used to
create a help file.  It is extremely flexible and offers many configurable features and the build process can
be changed depending upon the desired output format and presentation style.</p></div><div id="ID0RBSection" class="collapsibleSection"><p>As the tools are command-line based, they can be used in various ways such as in batch files,
MSBuild projects, and PowerShell scripts.  One downside to its command-line based nature and the flexibility it
offers with its various configuration files and presentation styles is a steep learning curve.  Using the tools
in their native form can be a daunting process so a good front end that hides the various details can greatly
simplify the process of using them.</p><p>An example GUI and some command line scripts are provided with the Sandcastle tools but they
provide limited functionality and do not expose enough of the configuration options to make them useful beyond a
few simple examples.  It is highly recommended that you use an open source front end such as the <a href="http://SHFB.CodePlex.com" target="_blank">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a>
that provides both a standalone GUI as well as Visual Studio integration.  It provides the usual project
management options and also many more features that can be used to produce better looking help files and to
author conceptual help topics.  It also hides the complexity of the Sandcastle tools and lets you focus on the
task of authoring the help content.</p><p>Sandcastle produces two types of help topic, each using a different build process.  The results
can be combined into a single help file.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Conceptual Content</strong> - This topic is an example of conceptual content.
It is written using Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML) and is used to create topics for general
conceptual information, walkthroughs, how-tos, etc.  For more information about MAML and how to use it, see the
<strong>Sandcastle MAML Guide</strong> that is available for installation along with the Sandcastle
tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>API Reference Content</strong> - Reference content is generated by using
reflection to generate information about one or more managed assemblies, the types it contains, and their members
and combining that information with the related XML comments extracted from the source code.  This produces
topics with a format similar to those you see on MSDN.  For more information about XML comments and how to use
them, see the <strong>Sandcastle XML Comments Guide</strong> that is available for installation along
with the Sandcastle tools.</p></li></ul><p>As noted above with regard to API reference content, Sandcastle is primarily for use in documenting
managed code assemblies that utilize the standard .NET Framework, Silverlight, the .NET Portable framework, or
the .NET for Windows Store Apps framework.  However, if you can produce a reflection information file for other
API types such as a JavaScript library, it is possible to document them as well.  For example, plug-ins exist for
the <a href="http://SHFB.CodePlex.com" target="_blank">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a> that allow you to document JavaScript libraries and XML schemas.  Currently, there is no
means of documenting unmanaged native code assemblies with Sandcastle.  However, if information about the
unmanaged API could be converted to a reflection information file, it would be possible to produce a help file.</p><p>It is important to note that Sandcastle itself does not generate the end result, a compiled help
file such as a Help 1 (CHM), MS Help 2 (HxS), or an MS Help Viewer (MSHC) file.  Instead, it relies on
third-party tools such as the Help 1 compiler in the HTML Help Workshop, the Help 2 compiler in the Visual Studio
SDK, or the third-party front ends to compress the content into an MS Help Viewer archive.  The HTML output by
Sandcastle is ready to use for website output but it lacks a front end to display the table of content in any
meaningful way and does not provide for searching or a keyword index.  Third-party tools such as the Sandcastle
Help File Builder can fill these gaps for you.</p></div><div class="collapsibleAreaRegion" id="seeAlsoSection"><span class="collapsibleRegionTitle" onclick="SectionExpandCollapse('ID1RB')" onkeypress="SectionExpandCollapse_CheckKey('ID1RB', event)" tabindex="0"><img id="ID1RBToggle" class="collapseToggle" src="../icons/SectionExpanded.png">See Also</span></div><div id="ID1RBSection" class="collapsibleSection"><h4 class="subHeading">Other Resources</h4><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><a href="1f2caa70-729b-48e1-9a9c-b612efd2f3b7.htm">Sandcastle Tools</a></div></div></div></div><div id="pageFooter" class="pageFooter"><p><a href="http://SHFB.CodePlex.com" target="_blank">[v2014.4.22.0] Sandcastle Tools</a></p><div class="feedbackLink">Send comments on this topic to
