This folder contains the three source code files I modified for the version of Managed ESent used by the
Sandcastle Help File Builder components.  My changes are indictated by comments prefixed with "!EFW".

    - Added static property to PersistentDictionaryFile to indicate reference type serialization status.
    - Updated ColumnConverter to allow serialization of reference types.
    - Added the option to PersistentDictionary to disable column compression using a new constructor.
    - Increased MaxVerPages in PersistentDictionary to 4096 as fast loading of large amounts of data in parallel
      fills the version store.
    - Added the option to utilize a local cache for read-only operations to speed up acces to the most recently
      used and frequently used values.
    - Strong named the assemblies.

Since they are only a few minor changes, I've opted not to distribute the full file set.  These files are from
the 1.7 release which can be downloaded from the following changeset URL:
