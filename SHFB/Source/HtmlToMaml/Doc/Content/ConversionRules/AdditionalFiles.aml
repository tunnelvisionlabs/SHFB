    <introduction>
      <para>The following files are created in addition to the converted topic files and can be found in the
destination folder after the conversion has completed.</para>

<definitionTable>
  <definedTerm>_Conversion.log</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>This file contains the output from the conversion process.  Refer to it to find any warnings and
notes on To Do items that need attention.</para>
	</definition>

  <definedTerm>_ContentTokens.tokens</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>The <token>SHFB</token> allows custom tags to appear in the additional content files that are
resolved at build time into project property values.  Since it is not allowable to place them directly in
MAML topics, they are extracted and replaced with a token.  The tags in the token file will be replaced at
build time with their project values and <application>BuildAssembler</application> will replace the tokens
in the topics with the resulting token value.  If no replacement tags are found, the token file will not be
created.</para>
	</definition>

  <definedTerm>_ContentLayout.content</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>This file contains the content layout based on the converted topics.  This can be added to a help
file builder project (version 1.8.0.0 or later) along with the converted files and folders and edited to set
the layout of the topics in the compiled help file.  If using some other documentation tool, you will need
to import the topics and define their layout using whatever tools that it may provide.</para>
	</definition>

  <definedTerm>The Media Folder</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>This folder will contain the media files (images) found during the conversion process.  These
files can be added to the help project.</para>
	</definition>

  <definedTerm>Media\_MediaFiles.xml</definedTerm>
  <definition>
		<para>This file is the media content file that contains the image IDs and alternate text values for
images referenced in <codeInline>mediaLink</codeInline> elements in the converted topics.  It can be added
to the help project or imported depending on how your documentation tool makes use of such files.</para>
