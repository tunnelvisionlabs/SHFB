      <para>Welcome to the HTML to MAML Converter.  This utility is used to convert HTML files to Microsoft
Assistance Markup Language (MAML) topic files so that they can be compiled into help files using
<token>Sandcastle</token> with the selected presentation style's look and feel.  The utility is located in the
<localUri>.\Extras</localUri> folder under the root help file builder installation folder (typically
<localUri>C:\Program Files (x86)\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder</localUri>).</para>

    <title>What is Conceptual Content?</title>
    <content>
      <para>Conceptual content allows you to define non-API documentation that is included in the help file
for usage notes, walkthroughs, tutorials, etc. Instead of HTML, conceptual content topics use Microsoft
Assistance Markup Language (MAML).  This is basically XML conforming to a well defined schema that describes
the structure of the conceptual content much like XML comments describe the structure of the code comments.
There is no layout or style information within the MAML files. Instead, they are ran through a series of XSL
transformations using Sandcastle's <application>BuildAssembler</application> tool similar to the reference
(API) content so that they match it in appearance and features.  This allows you to utilize the various
Sandcastle and third-party build components to alter and extend the presentation style used in the
topics.</para>

	<para>The term "conceptual content" is actually a catch-all term used to refer to the various types of
content that may appear in the help file.  MAML actually defines several different content types, each used
for a specific type of document (conceptual, glossary, how-to, reference, etc.).  Each type has a specific
structure with various required and optional XML elements.  For more information on MAML, the various topic
types, and the various elements that you can use within them, see the <legacyBold>Sandcastle MAML
Guide</legacyBold>.</para>

      <title>The Converter Utility</title>
      <content>
        <para>The purpose of this utility is to quickly convert a batch of HTML files (or
<localUri>.topic</localUri> files used by the <token>SHFB</token>) into MAML topics to save you from
having to do it manually.  Since the conversion to MAML is not perfect, you will still need to review the
topics afterwards to clean up any unresolved issues and To Do items noted in the conversion log.  The
converter will transform the HTML topics into the generic <legacyBold>Conceptual</legacyBold> topic format.
If you require that a topic conform to one of the other MAML topic formats such as
<legacyBold>Walkthrough</legacyBold>, <legacyBold>How To</legacyBold>, <legacyBold>Glossary</legacyBold>,
etc. you will need to make the necessary adjustments afterwards.</para>
