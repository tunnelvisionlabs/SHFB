      <para>This topic will walk you through using the converter to convert a batch of HTML files to MAML
topics.</para>

      <title>Using the Converter</title>

            <para>The converter is a console mode application.  As such, open a command prompt in order to
run it.  The utility is located in the <localUri>.\Extras</localUri> folder under the root help file builder
installation folder (typically <localUri>C:\Program Files (x86)\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder</localUri>).</para>

<alert class="note">
  <para>The converter uses an XML file that contains the
<link xlink:href="dcded896-51a7-4af4-b1dc-9a41193210cc">conversion rules</link>.  This file must reside in
the same folder as the converter's executable.</para>

        <step>
          <content>
            <para>The converter takes a folder name containing the files to convert as the first parameter
and the name of a new folder in which to place the converted topics and supporting files as the second
parameter.  The folder names must be different but the new folder does not have to exist and will be created
if necessary. Below is an example command line:</para>

<code language="none" title="Example Command Line">
ConvertHtmlToMaml.exe C:\MyLibrary\Doc C:\MyLibrary\Content
</code>

			<para>An optional parameter, <system>/companion</system>, can also be specified to create companion
files for the converted topics.  This is useful if your documentation tool, such as <token>DocProject</token>,
makes use of them to store the topic title, help attributes, and index keywords.</para>

<code language="none" title="Create Optional Companion Files">
ConvertHtmlToMaml.exe C:\MyLibrary\Doc C:\MyLibrary\Content /companion
</code>

			<para>An optional parameter, <system>/moveIntro</system>, can also be specified to indicate that the
converter should move any topic text preceding the first section element created into the introduction
element.  This option may produce better results in cases where your HTML topics contain leading text before
the first header element, such as an <codeInline>H1</codeInline> element, that should appear in the MAML
topic's <codeInline>introduction</codeInline> element.  If your topics lack an HTML header element, this
option will typically move the entire topic text into the introduction element which is probably not wanted
and the option should be omitted.  In that case, a default introduction element is inserted into each topic
and you can move text into it during the clean-up phase.</para>

<code language="none" title="Move Leading Text to Introduction">
ConvertHtmlToMaml.exe C:\MyLibrary\Doc C:\MyLibrary\Content /moveIntro
</code>

<alert class="note">
  <para>While the destination folder will be created if it does not already exist, it will not be cleared of
any existing content.  As such, you can convert multiple batches of files into one folder.  However, you
should rename the conversion log and the supporting files between runs if you want to keep them.</para>

          <content>
            <para>As the converter runs, it writes information to the console as it goes.  This information
is also saved to a <link xlink:href="b7e46af5-0901-41e8-afb9-a79a837aff9e">log file</link> in the
destination folder.</para>
          </content>
        </step>
        <step>
          <content>
            <para>Once finished, the <link xlink:href="40a012a8-5172-4805-a7b0-57a80e99ec5f">review process</link>
can begin to clean up any issues and To Do items in the converted topics.  The log file can help you locate
items that need attention.</para>
