[assembly: AssemblyDescription("This contains a set of build component reference link target classes used to " +
    "generate reference links in API topics.  They are separate from the main assembly as they are " +
    "serializable.  By separating them, they can be versioned independently of the main assembly so that " +
    "caches containing instances of the classes do not have to be rebuilt with every Sandcastle tools release.")]

// NOTE: See the description attribute for the reason this assembly is versioned independently of the others.
//       If this ever changes, we can switch to using the current date-based versioning scheme.
