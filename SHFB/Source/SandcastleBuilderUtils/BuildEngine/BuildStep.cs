// Version     Date     Who  Comments
// ==============================================================================================================
// 1.0.0.0  08/10/2006  EFW  Created the code
// 1.6.0.2  11/06/2007  EFW  Added new component configuration merge build step
// 1.6.0.5  02/04/2008  EFW  Added HTML Info Extract and Generate Inherited documentation build steps
// 1.6.0.7  03/24/2008  EFW  Removed the PurgeDuplicateTopics build step.  Added conceptual content build steps.
// 1.9.0.0  06/13/2010  EFW  Moved GenerateIntermediateTableOfContents so that it occurs right after
//                           MergeTablesOfContents.
// 1.9.0.0  06/30/2010  EFW  Added CombiningIntermediateTocFiles step and removed UpdateTableOfContents step
// 1.9.6.0  10/26/2012  EFW  Removed the FindingTools step and made the processing part of the Initializing step
//                           due to the need to locate configuration files during initialization.
// 1.9.8.0  06/21/2013  EFW  Moved CopyStandardHelpContent build step to allow for standard content defined in a
//                           presentation style definition file.  Removed ModifyHelpTopicFilenames as naming is
//                           now handled entirely by AddFilenames.xsl.
// -------  12/04/2013  EFW  Removed the ApplyVisibilityProperties build step.  Plug-ins can apply visibility
//                           settings if needed by calling the ApplyVisibilityProperties() method.  Moved the
//                           TransformReflectionInfo to support namespace grouping.
