// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Year of release
//      Month of release
//      Day of release
//      Revision (typically zero unless multiple releases are made on the same day)
//
// This versioning scheme allows build component and plug-in developers to use the same major, minor, and build
// numbers as the Sandcastle tools to indicate with which version their components are compatible.
//
// NOTE: This assembly is versioned independently of the others that use a shared version number.  This allows
// third party components that reference it to work with future versions of the core library unless a breaking
// change is made that requires a new version number in this assembly.
